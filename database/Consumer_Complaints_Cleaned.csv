3,3,10,72,"I have been working with Bank of America ( BOA ) ( also known as ; FIA Card Services ) to resolve an issue that they reported a payment as 30 days late to the XXXX credit reporting agencies. While it is factual that they did not receive payment, and I do not dispute that - they failed to update my billing instructions per my communication. I made this communication to all of my other credit cards and it was updated without issue. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I moved from XXXX to the United States. When I came back, a charge on my FIA card came back as 'suspicious ' and required me to call the fraud department to verify my address, contact information and other information. When I called, I instructed them to update my address in the system so my bill would be sent to that address. They failed to turn off electronic billing as part of that request, update my phone number, or billing address. I know that they failed to update this information because when I called to dispute the credit information, the BOA employee told me that their system showed that my mail was being returned. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX, a credit monitoring company, that negative information was posted to my report. That day, I located what account was being reported as late and immediately called BOA/FIA and made a payment to clear the entire balance to {$0.00}. At that point I explained the issue to the staff and they proceeded to argue that I was responsible ; they failed to notify me of my rights to file a dispute, so I escalated to a supervisor. After ~30 seconds the supervisor came on the phone and his tone was much nicer. He said that he would file a dispute and "" word it in a way that worked best for me, that hes working for me and knows what to put in the report so it comes out on my side ''. He did not collect other data, ask about my dispute or why I am disputing, or any of the facts that would typically be required to make a dispute. Essentially the dispute process was a joke ; but he left me feeling like it would be resolved. 

1 week later, I received a note from FIA card services that they "" investigated '' my dispute ( still unaware of what he put I was disputing ) and that they found the mark to be credible. This note looked auto-generated, without any care put into how the investigating addressed what I thought the issue was. 

I then filed a complaint with the XXXX. In response to this complaint, BOA reached out to me over the phone and initially told me that they had not, in fact, reported any negative information. After providing my social security number though, they were able to locate the account. The representative proceeded to say I was liable, and got me so upset by his lack of responding to my specific issues ( I updated my address when their fraud department called - why had BOA not done it in their system?, he claimed I was not receiving mail from BOA, despite the other associate saying their systems showed my mail was being returned ). I asked on the telephone to escalate to their supervisor and the associate did not transfer and said he needed to investigate more. The associate was a bully - I do n't know how else to explain it, and had cast his judgement early in the call. Mind you this was all being done before any investigation on my specific card was done by this associate. 

Facts : I asked for my address and contact information to be updated, and BOA failed to do so on a fraud prevention call. Had they done this I would have received notice about my bill. 

I will be buying a house in several months, and these negative remarks will have a negative consequence on my ability to secure a mortgage if BOA does not make this change. 

BOA did not take the investigation process seriously, intimidated me over the phone, and this is my last step before hiring an attorney. Given the address change and issues, BOA should not report this item.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'boa', 'also',

3,15,6,56,"I have been receiving calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX for some time now. They call not only the number I gave you but others as well. However since you 've asked me not to supply you with contact information in this statement I will not list them. 

They claim they are collecting from checks from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked them on numerous occasions not to call me anymore. They still continue to call me. Furthermore, not only do they call me still, they call me upwards of 10 times a day. I have printed out my call logs as proof. 

Besides the fact that they are obviously harassing me, I have also been hung up on in the middle of the conversation only to be called right back within minutes. I 've even been called by a supposed supervisor named XXXX who told me she heard the harassing phone calls and would rectify the situation. Well they never stopped. Some of the representatives who called me are named XXXX and XXXX. I never get a last name. 

At this point I am filing this complaint as I am an informed consumer. it was n't but 90 days ago where I had completed services with a credit consulting firm and they informed me of several laws regarding collections. I 've read the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and I know that they are not allowed to harass me. Besides the fact that the debts they are attempting to collect are not legitimate as I have contacted the banks that the collection agency claim the checks originate from, I know that the XX/XX/XXXX date they gave me make the debts past the statute of limitations for suing and credit reporting. Since they have now been informed not to contact me anymore and they continue to do so they are in severe violation of the F.D.C.P.A.

3,3,10,72,"I received a letter today from XXXX XXXX, regarding CFPB complaint XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, extension XXXX, and as always with all previous debt collection by BOA, no one actually answers these phone numbers. These letters are fake attempts to resolve complaints and are blatant attempts to collect a debt using "" we are a debt collector '' on the voicemail. As such, and since no debt is owed, I am instead writing yet another CFPB complaint to address what is so very wrong with the letter I received. First of all, this sentence is at issue : : '' We are able to confirm that there has been no avtivity on the closed account following these transactions '' XX/XX/XXXX. That is not what the fraud department at XXXX and XXXX told me! After receiving the initial hardcopy of my free report around XX/XX/XXXX in COLOR it losts 13 monthly payments on time. So it was verified in print and by phone that BOA did in fact report it. Yet the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX enclosed inside this envelope today by XXXX, says, "" Bank of America conducted an internal technology upgrade XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in an update to the national credit reporting agencies ... determined no bank error ... '' That is a lie. That is not what was printed on my hardcopy from XXXX when I called BOA on XXXX XXXX XXXX to tell them fraud had been committed by a bank employee and it is not what XXXX XXXX at XXXX fraud department told me either. None of the evidence agrees with what BOA keeps saying, falsely. Either BOA or BOA 's servicer posed as the bank to firnish false payment history which ca n't be explained by XX/XX/XXXX, since it FOLLOWS a years ' worth of payments that happened prior to the cited computer entry. XXXX cited a XX/XX/XXXX date. Each credit reporting agency cites different reporting at different times and in different ways pronts it on each of the XXXX reports. BOA also persists on looking at edited reports to find answers to their internal furnished data. It is not there. Some of the credit reports have since removed it because it is time-barred after XX/XX/XXXX. This is XX/XX/XXXX!!!!!!!!!! Ridiculous! All of this energy and resources to uphold erroneous data furnishing to XXXX credit reporting agencies on a debt that had XXXX value since XX/XX/XXXX defies logic and reason!!!!! Clearly the SEC should unvestigate BOA to see how many such "" assets '' are on the banks books to trick investors into thinking cash flow is generated when none was generated. There would be no other sensible reason to keep in place an account closed half a decade before BOA allegedly acquired it and which was a worthless asset "" dead on arrival '' asset that has generated zero income and yet had wasted many resources by the bank to deny they falsely reported it as I say they have. The facts are in my side. BOA ca n't manufacture fake documents and fake computer upgrades which are wholly inconsistemt with the printed records and expect any court in America to think fraud has not been committed. Recently, XXXX at the headquarters where this envelope was mailed - OH wait! where it was pretending to be mailed XXXX different zip codes : XXXX in XXXX and the XXXX XXXX meter at zip code XXXX in XXXX just adds to the deception! The letterhead adds to the deception with "" Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' where the whistleblower works. I filed my many complaints long before the whistleblower case hit the headlinrs but all I read about it this month reaffirms my own complaints. I contacted that attorney to add information. BOA has not been honest with me not the creditvreporting agencies. There was no reason whatsoever to update a closed account from XX/XX/XXXX nor should it have ever been added to BOA 's computer database at any point in time. All that BOA is making abundantky evident it lies.

Per the new payment plan, my interest would be reduced to 4.5 % and require monthly payments of {$420.00} for five years ( the "" Payment Plan '' ). In exchange for the Payment Plan, I was required to ( i ) get current on the card, which required payment of {$990.00}, and ( ii ) authorize BofA to auto-draft the XXXX monthly payments from my personal checking account. I agreed. 

On XXXX XXXX, BofA initiated the withdrawal of the monthly payment of {$420.00} from my account as agreed. However, BofA had not yet reduced the interest rate on the Account. This meant the monthly minimum payment for the Account ( roughly {$650.00} ) was higher than the $ XXXX monthly payment. So the debt continued to rise rather than decrease. 

On XXXX XXXX, I emailed my local BofA branch representative, XXXX XXXX, to see about getting the interest rate on the Account corrected. She advised that I call "" Card Services. "" On XXXX XXXX, I called Card Services and spoke to manager XXXX XXXX. After briefing her on the situation, XXXX XXXX indicated that BofA would not honor the terms of the Payment Plan and that no interest rate relief would be provided. She said that the Payment Plan had not been approved by the BofA credit department and, so, never went into effect. 

This was a curious assertion, given that BofA had already withdrawn the monthly payment from my account per the Payment Plan terms and had given no prior indication that it had rejected or cancelled the Payment Plan. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX and I called Card Services and spoke to manager XXXX XXXX. After recounting the events to her, XXXX XXXX confirmed that interest rate relief at 4.25 % APR was indeed noted on the Account. She agreed to call me with a resolution no later than XXXX XXXX, 2015. 

XXXX XXXX did not contact me on XXXX XXXX, 2015. In fact, she never contacted me again. 

Instead, while I waited to hear from XXXX XXXX, BofA withdrew, over my objection, another $ XXXX monthly payment from my checking account, and applied it to the Account. BofA still did not reduce the interest rate as agreed. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX again on my behalf. She spoke to manager XXXX XXXX, who indicated that BofA had decided not to honor the Payment Plan terms -- this, despite BofA 's continuing to take money from my checking account per the very terms it simultaneously disclaimed. 

BofA represented, both in word and action, that the Payment Plan was in effect, when in truth it had no intention of honoring its terms. Insofar as the Payment Plan terms are to my benefit, BofA disclaims them. On the other hand, those terms that benefit it, BofA embraces. To this day, BofA continues taking the $ XXXX monthly payments from my account, just as if the Payment Plan were in effect, yet denies me the benefit of the agreement. 

BofA 's intentionally misleading, deceptive, false and unfair conduct violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Promising debt relief as a ruse for collecting payments is also a violation of the Fair Debt Collection, among other common law principles.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['bofa',

But others are miscommunicating the term "" correctly reporting on your credit file '' which not true! Now - today - Bank of America has stripped their own computers of the furnished payment information in each month in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX ; such that the bank 's responders to disputes ca n't see what they furnished in XX/XX/XXXX that is still on my credit report. Bank of America fabricated phony credit card statements to show the XX/XX/XXXX closing by me. However, they ca n't create documents in XX/XX/XXXX, as promised two weeks ago? The bank is hiding the fraud on this account by deleting the furnished data. That is fraud. The envelope received today did not come from XXXX either, despite the return address. It has been an annoying habit that letters are mailed from Bank of America from states other than the one it is written from. I suspect this is the bank 's way of avoiding the Attorney General of the state listed from having jurisdiction on the matter. This is compounding an already disasterous situation for no reason.

1,8,5,28,"I am writing regarding a matter that has caused me serious financial ramifications, which could have been prevented had Bank of America been forthcoming with me, and followed their own procedures. On  XXXX  around  XXXX    XXXX   ( give or take an hour ) I inadvertently chose the wrong account during a transfer from my Checking Account (   XXXX   XXXX   ) on Bank of America 's mobile app. I sent {$1100.00} to my Credit Card account rather than my other  Checking Ac count (  XXXX  ). I called Bank of America immediately and spoke with their checking/debit department. The woman, I regret forgetting her name, informed me she had cancelled the transfer and told me I neednt take any further action. She further notified me that my {$1100.00} would appear back in Checking  XXXX , with verification via the mobile app once I refreshed the page. Upon refresh, the {$1100.00} was back in Checking  XXXX . I then completed my transfer from Checking  XXXX  to Checking  XXXX .     The next day (  XXXX  ) I noticed that my Credit Card account had an excess of around {$900.00} and that my Checking XXXX  was now - {$1100.00}. I called the  Checking/Debit D epartment back, explained that the first transfer was cancelled and asked what happened. They sent me to the Credit Card Department where the woman told me that they would be taking the  XXXX  sent to my Credit Card account and send it back to my  Checking  XXXX , balancing everything out. I was told it would take up to 10 days but it usually was a  3-5  day process.     Two days later (  XXXX  ) I checked my accounts to find that my Credit Card account was completely missing from the app, had been closed without my permission, and my Checking XXXX  was then charged  XXXX  {$35.00} fees. On Monday (  XXXX  ) I called again, spoke with the  Checking  Department who after being transferred to a supervisor credited me back the {$70.00} in fees. The supervisor told me that NO  ONE h ad indicated that the first transfer was cancelled or that it was a mistake, no one put notations in whatsoever. I was then transferred to the  Wealth Management  Department. The woman there could n't help me, but she put in a request for an investigation to try and get my Credit Card back open reinstating any balances I owed and have the {$1100.00} sent back to my Checking XXXX . She told me it would take upwards of 2 days.  Sidenote : My Rent  was due  XXXX  and I was waiting for a payment from  XXXX  of my jobs that was sent to  Checking  XXXX  on  XXXX , but since Checking  XXXX   was negative I did n't get the payment from my job. I 'm now facing upwards of {$200.00} in late fees due to having to wait for this Bank to fix this mess.     I received a call on Tuesday  XXXX  from the Investigator, but I was in a meeting. He left me a voicemail with  XXXX  numbers, his direct line and the  Wealth Management d epartment. He would n't answer his direct line, so I left a voice mail and then called the  Wealth Managemen  XXXX  Department again around  XXXX     XXXX  . The woman who answered had no idea what I was talking about, or what I was calling about. She sent me to  XXXX , a Credit Card  specialist.    XXXX  told me of some notes the e investigator l eft in the account. The amounts were guesstimates, I was too upset to remember all the amounts and for that I apologize. He told me "" The investigator left a note here, so please do n't shoot the messenger. We are unable to credit back the full amount as the Credit Card had an overdue balance owed of {$150.00}  (  guesstimate ) but the remaining {$150.00} ( guesstimate ) will be placed back into the credit card account after it has been re-opened and a check of {$950.00}  (  guesstimate ) will be sent. '' He then transferred me to another Credit Card Specialist,  XXXX   XXXX , who was extremely rude and insinuated I had made the error rather than the bank, and made it seem as if I was a criminal trying to scam them, rather than to get access to my own funds.      XXXX   XXXX  informed me that what  XXXX  said was incorrect. She told me that in her ""  nineteen y ears '' of being at Bank of America she had never seen anything like this happen and that they had closed the account because I paid it off. This, of course, despite the fact Bank of America has not had a mobile app for nineteen years. She ignored my explanation that the first original transfer was cancelled and had been a mistake. She was rude and talked down to me, then had the gall to offer me to re-open the CC to start a new line of credit. It was due to her attitude that made me realize I wanted to close all my accounts with Bank of America, and plan to do so at the next opportunity.     The purpose for my complaint is two fold. First, I dont believe anyone should have to go through the hassle, condescending attitude and horrible customer service afforded to me. Secondly, I want to ensure Bank of America refunds any and all fees and charges, apologizes, and assists me in transferring all of my business to another bank.       Please open the attachments I have with  XXXX   XXXX  as I have attached comments next to the highlighted items.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'am', 'writing', 'regarding', 'a',

1,8,23,88,"BankAmericard Travel Rewards Visa Signature  card - False advertising, bait and switch rewards program In early  XXXX  of  2017   , before my oversea trip I called Bank Of America about this card 's rewards redemption program. The program specifies that the reward points can be redeemed as statement credit to offset the travel expenses charged to this card, so i asked the BOA agent ( on the phone ) what type of travel expense would be qualified and I was told, "" any type of travel expense qualifies. '' Therefore, I advised him that I would be traveling overseas from  XXXX   XXXX  -  XXXX   XXXX  of this year and would be using this credit card there. While I was traveling overseas I purchased airline tickets using this credit card on   XXXX   ( an travel agency ) for about {$450.00}. After I came back from my vacation, on  XXXX   XXXX , I called BOA to redeem my reward points to offset this travel expense, but the agent told me he had trouble redeeming my points against my travel expense because there was some sort of coding error in my  XXXX  charge. He advised me to go ahead and pay off my travel expense first and then he will correct the posting code and redeem my reward points as statement credit later for me. But one week later I still do n't see the statement credit so I called BOA again on  XXXX   XXXX , and at first the agent said that I should be able to redeem my points against any travel expense but when she realized that the charge had coding error, she said she could n't do anything about it, that I had to contact the merchant ( mind you, in foreign country ) to correct the coding. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said "" it does n't matter, supervisor would n't be able to help in this case anyway. '' I ca n't believe her response! I feel so betrayed by BOA, because before the trip I specifically asked them what type of travel expense is eligible and was told "" any and all travel expense are eligible. '' And because of this response I decided to take this credit card on my trip and not any other brands of credit cards. I could have brought and used my  XXXX   XXXX  or  XXXX  or  XXXX  card for that purchase if BOA did n't lie to me!!

The bank says the chip on my card was read for this transaction and that is not possible since my car is always kept in my safe box and I only take it out when I travel to the USA. Im completely sure that no one had access to my card. I requested a copy on the vouchers for this transactions and I finally received them yesterday, and verified that the signature on this vouchers are not my signature and are very different from the signature I have registered at the bank, also the personal ID number on the voucher is not mine either.

Considering the amount on this transactions the merchant must have requested a valid ID at the moment of running the card and they should have verified if name on ID matched name on card. Also according to the security benefits the bank offers on credit cards they block transactions with abnormal behavior. This is a perfect example, first because the card was being charged by an overseas merchant for the first time and second the amount of more than  XXXX   XXXX  dollars for each transaction is not normal and the bank didn'tt block this transactions. With the facts Im providing you, should be enough reason to consider this transactions as fraud but the bank for the second time does not consider so.

The XXXX agencies are ( 1 ) Bank of America, the original debtor, ( 2 ) XXXX , XXXX, the junk-debt buyer, and ( 3 ) the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who is attempting to collect on behalf of XXXX , XXXX. 

I received written correspondence from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, claiming I owed {$78000.00}, with no reference as to what it was for. I understand upon initial written contact, the debt collector must provide me with certain information, including an itemized account claiming to be owed in connection with the debt including loan principal, interest, and all fees. Additionally, they are to provide me with the debtors name and last known address. On my own, I discovered they were attempting to collect a debt incurred by a business line of credit through Bank of America. Incidentally, I was terminated from that business XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, failed to provide me with the above information. 

I sent a dispute letter to the XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX ( return receipt ) well within the XXXX day time period. They have yet to respond, which I know they are n't obligated to do. However, I received a letter from Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX, also asking me to contact them regarding this alleged debt that THEY claim is for a mortgage loan. The convolution, ambiguity and confusion as to who actually owns this debt, and that no one can tell me exactly what it 's for, is of huge concern to me, and something I wanted to let you be aware of. 

Considering the above, I wish to inform you again that I was terminated from the company XX/XX/XXXX, also released from all current and future liability and obligations arising from the operation of that company, known or later discovered. My ex-husband was awarded the company as his sole and separate property in the Settlement Agreement. He warranted to me there was NO unsecured community debt, which means this line of credit was at a zero balance at the time I was severed from the company in XX/XX/XXXX. Any and all company debt incurred after XX/XX/XXXX, is the sole responsibility of my ex-husband and his company wherein he is 100 % owner. Of course my Marital Settlement Agreement is legally binding and has the full force and effect of a court order.

1,8,30,22,"I was in  XXXX  staying at the  XXXX  on  XXXX   XXXX  with my entire company for a trade show from  XXXX  when I lost my  Visa Debit Card  and woke up Tuesday morning of  XXXX   XXXX , followed my normal routine and checked my on line account to find o ver 25 tra nsactions in process mostly $  XXXX  {$570.00}. There were multiple transactions {$400.00} and above from purchases made from an unidentifiable merchant as well as other transaction from a  XXXX  's  XXXX  that not only am I a resident of  XXXX , but am not even a member at  XXXX  's  XXXX . There were al so 2 ATM   withdrawals of {$500.00} each of which I never made. I was n't even aware we could withdraw more than {$500.00} per day from an ATM. In the list of transaction on my checking account there were  2 forged chec ks using someone else 's check from a bank called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   which wrote "" Pay to the order of ************ and signed on the front and back for {$1300.00} and {$1700.00}. These are clearly forged checks that did n't come from me and not only are they holding me responsible for these checks, they assessed a {$12.00} return items fee on eac h one. They also withdrew money from my B of A credit cards, which I have 3 of, to pay for overdrafts resulting from this individual making these withdrawals and purchases. These 2 trans action for the checks were listed on my checking account and I clicked on the images to see them and printed them. When you go to my online account, they are mysteriously not listed anymore, I ca n't get an explanation for that or anything else.       Throughout the last almost 12 days, I would call to get status of the claims and was repeatedly reassured that I was 100 % protected by B of A and although it might take the full 10 days, they would return all of my   money back to my checking and savings accounts. I spoke to a rep yesterday because of the 2 letters I received regarding the 2 forged checks and she said not to worry about them and they were probably automatically generated and as of last night some time, which would have been the end of the 10 day period, even if they were unable to reach all of the merchants, B of A will have put back all of the money this person took from my account as well as any fees assessed and they would continue to reach out to the merchants.
This was obviously not the case and this morning when I called a woman casually let me know that my claims were denied and she was sorry. Although I never received one   phone call from any representative from B of A, she proceeded to tell me that it was denied because I not only confirmed that I had possession of the card, but that I authorized all of these transactions.       Needless to say I am speechless and have never felt more helpless. There is no possible way on earth that I would have approved ov er 25 transactions (  and they informed me there were many, many more transaction attempts, but they were not listed on my list of transactions ) of outrageous amounts and when I first spoke to B of A the morning whe  n I realized this happened the first thing I informed them about was the fact that I did not have my Visa Debit card anymore.
I ca n't imagine how anyone who either speaks to me and hears about this story or reads my condensed version about this here, would feel comfortable and feel that their family is safe with their money in checking and savings accounts with Bank of America.       Thank you and I look forward to your reply and what actions will be taken in this matter.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'was', 'in', 'xxxx', 'staying', 'at', 'the', 'xxxx', 'on',

2. XXXX has first hand knowledge of the facts stated herein. 
3. All the facts herein are true, correct and complete, admissible as evidence, and if called upon as a witness, XXXX will testify to their veracity. 

Plain Statement of FactsDefinitionAlleged Lender now is Bank of America N.A . 

4. There is no evidence that I/we have any outstanding liabilities or obligations with ALLEGED LENDER under the doctrine of ultra vires. By doctrine of ultra vires, a contract made by a corporation beyond the scope of its corporate powers is unlawful. XXXX believes there is no proof to the contrary. 

5. Alleged Lender failed to provide proof of FULL DISCLOSURE to all matters dealing with the above loan and said contract as required by law in the Truth-in-Lending Act pursuant to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Alleged Lender failed to provide me all documented information that I requested in the Qualified Written Request sent to the bank on XXXX XXXX, XXXX by RPOST Registered XXXX Mail XXXX.

Despite being given XXXX opportunities to provide proof of claim on this matter via certified mail, Alleged Lender can not and has not been able to provide presentment upon demand. XXXX alleges and believes that Alleged Lender is not the holder in due course, nor the real and beneficial party of interest for the above loan. 

7. ALLEGED LENDER failed to prove that they are the Note Holder in Due Course pursuant of U.C.C. - ARTICLE XXXX XXXX despite XXXX qualified written request 's demanding the Alleged Lender to stipulate and clarify this fact. No where on the loan documents or security deed was there mention of the word "" holder ''? Therefore ALLEGED LENDER fully admits that they are not the holder in due course, nor a real party of interest in the above loan. 

8. If in fact ALLEGED LENDER has the authority to enforce the contract through servicing and assignment, they have provided no proof of such authority despite XXXX written requests via RPOST certified email.

3,12,7,44,"Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, a mortgage servicer, acting as a debt collector, contacted me XXXX years after a foreclosure was conducted on a property I owned in Massachusetts. I had no prior knowledge of this mortgage servicer/debt collector, XXXX prior to this contact. I had a XXXX and XXXX mortgage on the property at the time of foreclosure. Both mortgages were serviced by the same company : initially Countrywide and later Bank of America. BofA conducted the foreclosure in XX/XX/XXXX. 

1 ) According to MA state law, a mortgagee or mortgage servicer needs a deficiency judgement to collect remaining loan debt after a property foreclosure. In order to seek deficiency judgement, the mortgagee must provide proof of having sent a notice of intention to pursue any deficiency after a foreclosure. This notice must be sent by registered mail at least XXXX days prior to the foreclosure. Also, the mortgagee must sign and swear to an affidavit of the mailing of the above notice within XXXX days after the foreclosure. 

XXXX has not presented me with a deficiency judgement on the debt they are attempting to collect. They have not provided evidence that a notice of intention was sent to me or that an affidavit was produced as described above even when these documents or proof were specifically requested by me in a dispute letter. 

2 ) In addition, MA law has a statute of limitation for attempting to collect a debt of deficiency from a foreclosure of XXXX years. This attempt to collect the debt is XXXX years past the expiration of the allowed timeframe. 

3 ) XXXX made reports to the major credit bureaus about this debt that now appear as negatiave reports on all my credit histories. These reports have negatively affected my credit score at a significant level. I consider this reporting to be fraud and defamation. They also ignored a direct request to retract their reports to credit bureaus until they can prove the validity of the debt. 

4 ) XXXX has "" threatened '' foreclosure on the property attached to the XXXX mortgage. I do n't believe they can foreclose on a property that has already been sold in foreclosure. XXXX appears to have partial or incomplete information on this loan and its disposition. They never refer to the previous foreclosure or a deficiency after foreclosure. I no longer have any ownership or legal access to this property. I consider this to be fraud and making false statements in attempting to collect a debt. 

XXXX ) I have never received any notification that this loan had been sold and/or transferred to another bank/lender, OR that the loan had a new servicer. The documentation from Nationstar states that the loan is now held by "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee for XXXX Home Equity Loan Asset Backed Certificates, Series XXXX. '' At the time of foreclosure, the mortgagee was XXXX with Bank of America as servicer. I never heard anything from BofA or XXXX after the foreclosure was complete. However, I did receive communication and settlement funds from federal and state government as part of class action settlements with BofA for illegal foreclosure practices. 

6 ) The amount XXXX claims I owe and are trying to collect appears to be based on partial or incomplete information. The foreclosure that occurred back XX/XX/XXXX netted over {$35000.00} MORE than the balance on the XXXX mortgage. There is no mention of the funds from the auction of the property or of any funds being applied to the XXXX mortgage. XXXX claims that I owe the balance of the loan prior to foreclosure, about {$52000.00} PLUS an additional $ XXXX for interest and fees. Again, I would consider these amounts to be false statements, threats, and fraudulant.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['beginning', 'in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'a', 'mortgage', 'servicer', 'acting',

3,3,33,102,"I XXXX XXXX make a claim with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) that the following attached attempt to collect a debt is highly fraudulent. My personal information is being floated in what is known in the debt collection business as a "" debt Pool '', whereas collection information is outdated and not even enforceable. The attached collection from XXXX XXXX, XXXX does not state that the debt is no longer enforceable, a stipulation by the Federal Trade Commission. The method of an illegal posting of a collection on my personal credit report, or an illegal collection against my rights of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can not be tolerated. In Federal Trade Commission v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( 2009 ) the federal district court decided in favor of the Federal Trade Commission that a collection agency must operate within strict guidelines in the collection of a debt. The criteria are as follows : 1 ) The debt must still be enforceable within the state of procurement or where the original obligator resides, or a combination of both. 
2 ) The debt collector must be licensed and bonded if applicable within the state in which it is trying to collect, if the debt is collectable. 
3 ) The validation of debt ownership must be proved, without exception. 
There is no statement on the attached collection that the debt is no longer enforceable. The collection agency stipulates that Bank of America obtained a judgment against me. By legal mandate, the docket number of the judgment must be listed as well as what county clerk 's office the judgment is filed with. In this case, there is no judgment. The statement saying "" This judgment may be forwarded to an attorney for execution '' is a complete falsehood. There can not be a lawsuit as the legal time limit to enforce a summary judgment action has passed. 
Even though the collection letter states that illegal, abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collections are illegal, this collection in its entirety is just that, a deceptive illegal attempt to collect a debt that is no longer enforceable.

5,7,9,59,"I started school XX/XX/XXXX and took a leave XX/XX/XXXX and never went back until XX/XX/XXXX.I got access to my Student Portal where I noticed a disbursement of {$4400.00} that was suppose to go to me but I never received.During that time our remaining Financial Aid Money would be deposited to a Bank of America Prepaid Cash Pay Card.I brought it to my schools attention and they began investigating trying to locate the money and find out what happened to it.Like I mentioned I was n't aware of that disbarment because I took a leave XX/XX/XXXX and did n't go back until XX/XX/XXXX.It took the school a while to give me answers, they eventually contacted Bank of America to try and get some answers and all they sent thru an email was a statement showing that there was a deposit made on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$4400.00}, that 's it.My school went ahead and replied saying that we were actually trying to find out what happened to the money, how was it used or spent because I never touched it, so again they replied with a short answer saying Student used all funds, which in fact I never did.They did n't provide any information about how it was used, spent, was it withdrawn? Used somewhere? Nothing! I want to find out what happened to that money because I never saw it or used it. This has caused me a lot of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Bank of America had agreed to send me all statements from XX/XX/XXXX to this current day.They emailed me but only sent XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX to current day.I could n't file a complaint or even dispute it cause according to them its been more than 365 days which I understand but there has to be records of how the money was used and who used it because obviously to withdraw that amount of money an ID is required. I had my card in a safe place so there was no chance for anyone to have used it. Also Bank of America mentioned that if the money does n't get used in certain amount of time it gets returned to the sponsor which is my school and the school stated that they never received anything. I please ask that you help me, I want my money and I want to find out what happened to it.

0,2,28,106,"I had to open  XXXX  disputes with  Bank of America  on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  after experiencing a medical event prior to that weekend that left me with no memory of approximately four days which would have been from  XXXX . During that time there were  XXXX  transactions made that I am unaware of making those being as follows :  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   (  XXXX , SC  XXXX  {$20.00}  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX   XXXX  {$86.00}  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  ( ATM Withdraw ) {$100.00} Now when the claims were made at the local BOA Branch ( Near  XXXX   XXXX  ) in  XXXX , SC with the banker sitting at her desk and placing me on the speakerphone so she heard everything that was stated. I informed them that I was unaware of making these charges and would like to dispute them, we went through the general questions about where was the card kept, where was the PIN kept, Was it ever out of my reach, etc. I explained to them that first off I had no memory of those days because of the transient global amnesia ( which I sent the medical release records to them ) and even informed them they could contact the releasing doctor because with this condition you may never remember events, can be talked into doing things you normally wouldnt and have no memory of them, etc. I informed them that my card is kept in my phone case near my Drivers license which has my birth-date on it, which the year was the PIN and anyone could have had access to that information when I was knocked out, asleep or whatever because even my tox screen test showed high levels of toxins in my system that I did not ingest. They said that they would start the dispute process and make a general decision to offer temporary credit or not within 10 days while they research the claims. Again the claims were broken into  XXXX  claim s Claim  # :  XXXX  ( for the {$86.00} and {$20.00}  )  and Claim # :  XXXX  ( for the {$100.00}  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ).  Well everything seemed to be going fine I was issued temporary credit for the {$100.00}  ( Claim  #  XXXX  ) and was checking on the status of the  Claim  #  XXXX , which was never issued temporary credit for and still has not been. But of note it should be noted that on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  @  XXXX  I received a call from a  XXXX  with the fraud department whose message stated verbatim as follows "" Hello this is  XXXX  call from  Bank of America Fraud Claims  this message is for  XXXX   XXXX   if  you could please return my call at your earliest convenience at  XXXX  again that number is  XXXX  ). I saw the message and called her back it was  XXXX  and since their was no extension to call I had to go through the customer service side which took roughly  10 mi nutes only to be patched over to the claims department where that agent looked into the claim and said they were calling to ask me some questions about the claim, which were the same questions answered when the claim was filed at the bank location and then stated that the claim had been denied because they could not reach me when they contacted me for this information. I informed him that this was not even 20 minutes ago since I was contacted for this information and I was informed that he was sorry all he could do was ask that the claim be reopened but that no temp credit would be issued since the claim had been denied. I even informed him I wanted to speak to  XXXX  manager because how can you deny a claim with in 20 m inutes of calling someone and stating to call you back at their earliest convenience, if it was that important shouldnt something else have been said. He just apologized and stated that he would put in the request and someone would call me back within  24-48 hours. This infuriated me so I emailed the BOA  president on Saturday morning about this matter and ask him to get involved because this was not right to cancel a claim after  20  minutes of calling someone and not telling them you needed to speak to them by the end of the day. I wake up this morning  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  and receive emails stating that the claim for #  XXXX  was reversed and the temporary credit would be withdrawn from my account on  XXXX   XXXX  and to contact them if I needed copies of what they used to make their decision. I contacted them and spoke to a agent by the name of  XXXX  out of Georgia, who informed me the claims were linked ( meaning the same agent could have worked both claims ) and that the claim was denied because I had a history with   XXXX   of a purchase on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  ( which I asked him how does one purchase in like 5 months establish a history with the merchant, and he said that was  one  reason it was denied, then he stated that I had stated that the card was always in my possession and no one else never had access to my PIN, and since the PIN was entered correctly the first time the research team had decided I made the purchase ), which I never informed them I informed them of exactly what is written above in beginning of this complaint. I feel as if this research department is ignorning information  (  both medical and about the location of PIN and card that has been given to them since the beginning of these disputes ) and feel that this is in retaliation by the bank or the banks employee for me reaching out to the  President  on Saturday to state my issues with his claim representative closing the claim with in 20  minutes of calling a customer.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'had', 'to', 'open', 'xxxx', 'disputes', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'after', 'experiencing',

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX We missed our first Mortgage payment. 
XXXX - We were "" served '' an official letter from XXXX demanding payment in full of the {>= $1,000,000} loan. I called and spoke to, "" XXXX XXXX '' who was absolutely horrible and said if we did n't pay the loan off, they could have us "" out of our home by XXXX '' We had a new baby girl and XXXX XXXX XXXX boy/girl twins ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was their XXXX Birthday party. I will never forget how painful that was ) Attorney gave me the run down and timeframes so I could plan accordingly. We moved out of the home and lived with family to avoid a "" Sheriff style eviction '' Foreclosure never happened, we were in limbo, not sure what to do. We moved back in temporarily. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Eventually, at the advice of an attorney, XXXX filed Bankruptcy. He got a job in XXXX so we moved to XXXX to rebuild. 
XXXX - The mortgage finally drops off our credit report because of the federal Statute of Limitations. For 6 years we could n't get a car loan, rent a house, or finance anything without lots of help. Even with a co signor, a {>= $1,000,000} mortgage that is unpaid for 6 years is a big deal. We thought this was the end, and things would finally start to get better. We got a $ XXXX/month car loan and start to rebuild. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - Surprise ... A Notice of Trustee Sale is recorded for the sale of our home after over 7 years of demanding payment in full, and no follow through. XXXX called the attorney representing the trustee told him I did n't think they had the right to foreclose because it had been 7.5 years since they called the note due and XXXX State has a 6 year statute of limitations. He was an arrogant jerk and said he could rely on whatever the bank was giving him and if I did n't like it, we had to retain an attorney and sue the bank to stop them. We had also done some research and told him that this was Agriculture property and they could legally not Non Judicially foreclose, they had to go through the courts system and the burden would XXXX to them to prove they had the right to foreclose. He did n't like this at all and got really mad and said he did n't even have to talk to me and I needed to get an attorney to talk to him from there on. For the next year we get notices saying that the sale is continued. We hire an attorney to write a few demand letters but they ignore them and take the position, if we do n't like it, we have to sue them. We demand that they prove they have legal standing and have complied with all the state and federal lending and foreclosure laws. They ignore us and say they do n't have to prove anything, state law does n't require them to. Sale dates come and go, and get continued without an actual sale. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Trustee records a discontinuance of the previous sale and sets a new date for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a new Notice of Trustee Sale. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Current Sale date for the most recent Notice of Trustee Sale. 
Current : Just learn now that we can not get a new Mortgage together, and start over, until another XXXXXXXX years AFTER the foreclose date that has n't even happened yet!!! XXXXXXXX years of punishment. 
They are n't lawfully allowed to foreclose and I think they know it, but they have unlimited financial resources and we do not. So, they will keep threatening and just do what they want to do because they can operate above the law. This is wrong and we need help, please.

On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  there were  four overd raft item fees totaling {$150.00}. On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  there wer e four additional  {$35.00} overdraft fees totaling {$140.00}. On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX , there was an overdraft fee of {$35.00}.   On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX , my account balance was - {$450.00}. At approximately  XXXX   XXXX , I contacted customer service about consolidating or reducing the overdraft fees which totaled {$320.00} from the period  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  to  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX . I was connected with a representative in t he Overdraft Collections  Department who agreed to reduce the fees to a total of {$160.00}. I was told that the difference would be credited upon by account balance becoming positive. Upon the conclusion of our conversation I asked if there was a reference number for our conversation in case there was an issue. I was told that she would make notes in the system regarding our conversation.   On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX , money was deposited into my account bringing my account balance to + {$1000.00} On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  I contacted  the Overdraft Collections Depar tment at  XXXX  to inquire as to why I had not been credited the difference from the reduced fee. I spoke with  XXXX   XXXX , the collection s manager. I was  told that they had no record of my agreement and that they could not help me as my account was no longer over-drafted.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['b', 'ank', 'of', 'america', 'm', 'anipulated', 'my', 'balance', 'by', 'debiting', 'and', 'then', 'reposting', 'cashiers', 'check', 'and', 'then', 'retroactively', 'charged', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'i', 'purchased', 'a', 'cashiers', 'check', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'for', 'one hundred and fifty thousand', 'from', 'a', 'maryland', 'b', 'ank', 'of', 'american', 'branch', 'an', 'd', 'one hundred and fifty thousand', 'one thousand', 'fee', 'for', 'cashiers', 'check', 'was', 'debited', 'from', 'my', 'account', 'leaving', 'me', 'with', 'a', 'balance', 'of', 'xxxx', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'one hundred and fifty thousand', 'was', 'posted', 'back', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'giving', 'me', 'a', 'balance', 'of', 'over', 'one hundred and sixty thousand', 'that', 'night', 'two', 'xxxx', 'transactions', 'were', 'drafted', 'from', 'my', 'account', 'for', 'one thousand, four hundred', 'and', 'one thousand, eight hundred', 'my', 'account', 'was', 'still', 'grossly', 'positive', 'the', 'next', 'morning', 'on', 'xxxx', 'i', 'checked', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'the', 'one hundred and fifty thousand', 'which', 'had', 'been', 'debited', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'reposted', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'had', 'been', 'retroactively', 'debited', 'back', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'th', 'e', 'two', 'xxxx', 'transactions', 'from', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'were', 'retroactively', 'marked', 'as', 'overdrafts', 'even', 'though', 'hours', 'before', 'they', 'appeared', 'to', 'be', 'cov', 'ered', 'the', 'y', 'and', 'i', 'was', 'assessed', 'fees', 'totaling', 'seven thousand', 'even', 'though', 'i', 'was', 'checking', 'my', 'balance', 'bank', 'of', 'americas', 'manipulatio', 'n', 'of', 'my', 'balance', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'transfer', 'additional', 'money', 'in', 'time', 'to', 'cover', 'drafts', 'from', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'i', 'was', 'penalized', 'through', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'separately', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'contacted', 'the', 'boa', 'overdraft', 'collections', 'dep', 'artment', 'at', 'xxxx', 'to', 'discuss', 'multiple', 'overdraft', 'charges', 'which', 'had', 'occurred', 'as', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'scheduled', 'payments', 'being', 'drafted', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'which', 'had', 'subsequently', 'developed', 'insufficient', 'funds', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'were', 'four', 'overd', 'raft', 'item', 'fees', 'totaling', 'fifteen thousand', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'wer', 'e', 'four', 'additional', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'totaling', 'fourteen thousand', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'was', 'an', 'overdraft', 'fee', 'of', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'my', 'account', 'balance', 'was', 'forty-five thousand', 'at', 'approximately', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'contacted', 'customer', 'service', 'about', 'consolidating', 'or', 'reducing', 'the', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'which', 'totaled', 'thirty-two thousand', 'from', 'the', 'period', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'was', 'connected', 'with', 'a', 'representative', 'in', 't', 'he', 'overdraft', 'collections', 'department', 'who', 'agreed', 'to', 'reduce', 'the', 'fees', 'to', 'a', 'total', 'of', 'sixteen thousand', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'the', 'difference', 'would', 'be', 'credited', 'upon', 'by', 'account', 'balance', 'becoming', 'positive', 'upon', 'the', 'conclusion', 'of', 'our', 'conversation', 'i', 'asked', 'if', 'there', 'was', 'a', 'reference', 'number', 'for', 'our', 'conversation', 'in', 'case', 'there', 'was', 'an', 'issue', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'she', 'would', 'make', 'notes', 'in', 'the', 'system', 'regarding', 'our', 'conversation', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'money', 'was', 'deposited', 'into', 'my', 'account', 'bringing', 'my', 'account', 'balance', 'to', 'one hundred thousand', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'contacted', 'the', 'overdraft', 'collections', 'depar', 'tment', 'at', 'xxxx', 'to', 'inquire', 'as', 'to', 'why', 'i', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'credited', 'the', 'difference', 'from', 'the', 'reduced', 'fee', 'i', 'spoke', 'with', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'the', 'collection', 's', 'manager', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'they', 'had', 'no', 'record', 'of', 'my', 'agreement', 'and', 'that', 'they', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'me', 'as', 'my', 'account', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'overdrafted']"

At  XXXX   XXXX , I noticed my bank account was now showing an overdraft of - {$50.00}. I quickly transferred {$100.00} into my checking account This cerated a positive balance in my account of + {$49.00}.     Then later that same day I made several more small deposits ( {$2.00}. and {$10.00} ) followed by one withdrawal of {$60.00}. This left a positive balance of {$1.0 0}, ( a gain this was on Monday afternoon  XXXX  ) I continued to monitor the account until approx.  XXXX    XXXX    that night and the balance remained at {$1.00}.     Then on  XXXX   XXXX , at  XXXX   XXXX  I received an email eleart notifying me that I was charged with  2 ( two ) overdraft fee charges of {$35.00} each ( {$70.00} ). The total amount of all the overdrafts was showing - {$100.00}, so I immediately deposited an aditional {$40.00} to clear any overdraft fees. ( - {$100.00} + {$40.00} = - {$68.00} ). So, if the fees ( {$70.00} ) were reversed I would have a positive balance of {$1.00}. I immediately called and asked for the fees to be reversed but was flat out denied.

This was before my first account was frozen. After the freeze I sent the information as hard copy and still the problem has not been resolved and I still have no access to my money.

The funds were immediately electronically withdrawn from  XXXX   XXXX  & deposited into my account. On  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  ,  four  days after the transaction was completed, Bank of America seized the {$250.00} from my account. As reviewing my account transactions on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , I observed that  BOA  had seized my deposit. I immediately began calling BOA customer service centers to resolve the problem. I was told on  3  separate calls to  BOA  customer service centers that the money was seized because the original check could not be verified. BOA claims the bank check could not be read well enough to be verified, yet their online banking center provides me a crystal clear image of the check in question. BOA read the check well enough to withdraw the funds from the correct  XXXX   XXXX  account, yet could n't read it well enough to keep the funds where deposited? I contacted the   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX   customer to discuss the issue & see if their funds were returned. The   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    customer immediately began investigating the fund withdrawal through a  XXXX   XXXX  telephone representative. The investigation with  XXXX   XXXX  found that t BOA  did not try to return the seized funds to the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   or the  XXXX   XXXX  customer. BOA did not make any effort to notify me that they were actively withdrawing money from my account for any reason. My calls to  BOA  resulted in rhetorical circle explanations stating there was nothing I could do whatsoever to resolve the problem. In the manner in wh ich BOA  dismissed this issue, offering no resolve or assistance ; I do not believe this is an isolated incident. I firmly believe that BOA is performing these types of scenarios to people ( especially since the amounts are low enough to not afford a lawyer to take to court ). I truly believe  BOA  is running a scam, in small amounts to avoid massive public push back. They target random people, hoping to prey upon the elderly or individuals who speak  XXXX  as a second language who do n't know how to push back against an enormous corporation. The fact that the seized funds of {$250.00} makes me all the more suspect. Who, in their right mind, would hire an expensive lawyer to fight for {$250.00}? No one.

1,8,25,80,"Hello Ive been a Bank of America client for many years and have had this particular card for over 17 years.   My complaint pertains to an issue with BOAs online bill pay system that malfunctioned and led me to be marked late for the month of  XXXX   XXXX  for a payment that was due on  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX .     Bank of America at the time me on an auto payment system called Net Access Payment which required that I indicate a specified minimum payment amount after manually checking what the minimum payment is and that amount would automatically be deducted from my bank account.   But this meant that if the minimum increased, l Bank of America would still take out pre-set payment amount, thereby the payment that would be taken out would not be sufficient to cover the minimum payment.   My company requires me to travel a lot due to which I have auto payments setup for all accounts. I called BOA multiple times to try to get an actual auto payment system setup where I did not have to manually change the payment amount constantly, but was told at the time that no solutions existed and that I login from time to time to adjust the montly payment.     Back in late  XXXX  and early  XXXX  I logged into the BOA system and checked the minimum payment had been adjusted to {$170.00}. Therefore, I changed the auto payment amount accordingly to be a bit over the {$170.00}, as I wanted to take advantage of the 0 % apr and not payoff the account too quickly.     After doing this I began to travel all over the country for a period of 3 months for work and assumed payments were being taken out and the account was current. All the while I made sure no additional purchases were made with the account, as otherwise the minimum payment would have adjusted and I would constantly need to re-adjust the auto payment amount.     Finally upon returning home in early  XXXX   XXXX , I found my credit report score had gone done, as a late payment for  XXXX   XXXX  was reported by Bank of America. There were no calls or emails from Bank of America prior to this alerting me of any problems.     I would find that firstly BOA did not take out a payment for  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , that I had setup as the auto payment amount, and only took out a  XXXX  payment for {$170.00}.   Additionally, I was told that the payment due for  XXXX  was not the {$170.00} that I saw in  XXXX  after I had made the last balance transfer transaction, but instead had moved up to {$290.00}. The reason I was given is that when I logged into the BOA system on  XXXX   XXXX  to check my minimum payment, although the balance transfer for {$8000.00} had registered and the balance I saw was the updated balance, bu t BOA id not  adjust the payment until the following month.     Now had I known about this I would have certainly increased the payment amount.   I had over {$5000.00} in my checking account at the time, which was more than enough to cover the minimum payment. I have attached a copy of my bank statement for this.     I have called Bank of America and despite me being put on hold for ove r 30 minutes , they were not able to figure out why their own auto payment failed to take out the  XXXX  payment.","BANK OF

1,8,30,35,"CONSUMER 'S ORIGINAL COMPLAINT Reference : Bank of America Case No.  XXXX  On  XX/XX/XXXX , I initiated a billing dispute with my credit card issue r ( Bank of America ) regarding illegally collected travel tax charged on my credit card by merchant (   XXXX   XXXX   ).  On  XX/XX/XXXX , I sent another supplemental statement to Bank of America outlining the specifics of my billing dispute with  XXXX   XXXX . On  XX/XX/XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX  processed my refund application for the illegally collected travel tax amounting to {$120.00}. To date, refund has not been processed by said merchant. On  XX/XX/XXXX , I received a letter from Bank of America stating they were unable to intervene in situations involving sales tax. It is glaringly clear from such correspondence that Bank of America  Credit Billing Dispute  never bothered to read the specifics of the billing dispute and the issues pertaining to prompt refund of the billing disputes in question. I spoke to a certain (  XXXX   )  a supervisor/manager from Bank of America who was not at all very helpful. I told him why is Bank of America stating on its billing dispute letter dated XX/XX/XXXX  that it can not doing anything not about sales tax when it was about something else. He responded that it was a standard letter generated by Bank of America. I told him it was incorrect and nobody including his staff was reading the specific issues addressed in my billing dispute letters of  XX/XX/XXXX  &  XX/XX/XXXX . It was about additional billing ( illegally collected ) charged by the merchant for travel tax which customer is exempted from paying. I have already provided the merchant documents to prove that the transaction is exempted from travel tax and proof to Bank of America. Yet, Bank of America continues to disregard this matter and specifically address the issues addressed in the billing dispute. Merchant to date has not processed my refund for the billing dispute in question either. Bank of America is clearly in violation of  XXXX  Credit Card Core Rules on investigating and for failing to resolve customer 's billing dispute including violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act.     BANK OF AMERICA 'S RESPONSE Our research revealed that the credit card account ending in  XXXX  was opened on  XX/XX/XXXX . On  XX/XX/XXXX , you contact Bank of America by way of telephone to dispute portions of two transactions on your account. The disputed transactions are as follows : {$96.00} of the transaction in the amount of {$1900.00} ; and {$32.00} of the transaction in the amount of {$720.00}. These transactions were with the merchant  XXXX   XXXX , which posted to your account on  XX/XX/XXXX . Correspondence was mailed to you on  XX/XX/XXXX , explaining that Bank of America is unable to intervene in situations involving a sales tax. Please understand that either a state or country has the right to impose a sales tax on a purchase. By giving your account number to the merchant and/or signing the sales slip, you authorized them to bill your account for the amount in question. The documents you provided with your claim is inapplicable and does not void the Travel Tax. In order to support your claim, a sales receipt needs to be provided that shows a different amount should have been billed by the merchant  XXXX   XXXX . If you do have such a receipt in your possession, it can be faxed directly to Bank  of Americas  claims team at  XXXX  or mailed to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , TX  XXXX . The  Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) , which was created to assist consumers with incorrect or unauthorized transactions, states to protect your billing rights you must write to us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. Additionally, if you have an automated payment scheduled, please notify us at least  three  business days before the scheduled payment if you want to stop the payment from posting to your account. You are required to specify your name and complete account number, the amount of the transaction, the reason why you think the transaction is in error, and your letter must be mailed to the address specified for billing inquiries. Bank of America must work within all rules established by Card Associations and bank guidelines regarding customer disputes. I regret, in your case, we are unable to assist further with your dispute at this time without the additional previously requested information. We also suggest you continue to pursue this matter directly with the merchant to come to a satisfactory resolution. Account Ending In :  XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX  Contact Us :  XXXX  Extension  XXXX  Pag ge  1 of 2 Ag ain, thank you for your feedback and for affording us the opportunity to respond. Although it is n ever pleasant to hear our customers have been dissatisfied, we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.     COMPLAINANT 'S RESPONSE : Bank of America continues to be in violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act for failing to resolve the billing dispute in question. The merchant has processed complainant 's refund demand on  XX/XX/XXXX  ( as evidenced by complaint 's correspondence dated  XX/XX/XXXX ,  XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX  previously provided to Bank of Americ a ).  However, to date Bank of America continues ignore the fact that the merchant has acknowledged complainant 's billing dispute and not done anything in good faith to refund the travel tax illegally collected in violation of their own refund rules . Complainant has c onsistently followed the merchant 's refund procedures in good faith but Bank of America and the merchant continues to ignore this matter. Conversely, Bank of America has not provided complainant about the merchant 's response to this matter either to date.     All the documents and the facts presented to Bank of America and the merchant constitute valid legal defenses for a billing dispute. Additionally, the specific details of the billing dispute were also outlined very clearly and Bank of America has not addressed those issues either.     Complainant has no legal obligation to pay merchant for fees illegally collected and it is Bank of America primary responsibility as a party to the transaction to ensure the merchant bill a consumer correctly.     Bank of America continues to ignore and not comply with all the rules established b y Card Associations and  bank guidelines regarding customer billing disputes.     On  XX/XX/XXXX , Bank of America issued a credit of {$32.00} for only  one  of the disputed transactions. The remaining {$96.00} billing dispute has still not been credited to complainant 's account.     CFPB should take the appropriate steps to sanction Bank of America for continued violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act and not working within all the established Card Associations ( specifically   XXXX   XXXX   Core Rules ) and its own bank guidelines regarding billing disputes.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['consumer', 's', 'original', 'complaint', 'reference', 'bank', 'of',

0,2,20,82,"On the evening of  XXXX   XXXX ,    2017  I was out with my wife for our wedding anniversary. I attempted to withdrawal money from an atm machine and was denied. I checked my balance and there was plenty of money. I tried several more times with no luck. I called my bank customer service ( too k over 30 minutes ) the service person said I was over my daily withdraw limit. I let her know that I have not  used my atm yet and it must be from the machines that were not letting me get money. She made some adjustment and I was able to get cash from the atm. The following morning  XXXX / XXXX /   17  I looked at my account and saw there was activity on my card from an atm machine earlier on the  XXXX . I called Bank of Am erica customer service again and let them know of the fraudulent atm activity. There was also one show ing for  XXXX / XXXX / 17 . Both of these withdraws were in different cities than all of my legitimate charges. I was informed that my card would be cancelled and they transferred me to the fraud department. I was on hold for  over 30 min utes and I had to hang up. The next morning  XXXX / XXXX / 17  I got on the phone again to file the full fraud information and again was on hold for o ver 30 m inutes and couldnt keep holding because I was at work. I then noticed that another atm withdrawal happend on  XXXX / XXXX / 17 . I was very unsure how this could happen if Bank of America cancelled the card. I ended up taking a day off and going into the bank office to file the case. After their investigation I was denied because they said I waited too long to file. When I argued that I have phone records fro m 3 straig ht days of trying to file the case the decided to reopen it. They have again denied coverage because they claim I knew of the charges because I accessed my online banking. When I asked how my card was turned back on the bank says that I called and said there was no fraud and to turn it back on. There is absolutely no common sense in this. Why would I call about fraud then call to turn it back on. These atm fraud withdrawals were made while the same card was being used in another city? How can the bank not have an alert for this.

Checking their website the following day I found reservations were mistakenly listed for travel on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX   (  XXXX  for  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   ).   I called  XXXX  immediately to ask that they correct their error . ( See results above ) Our  international flight from  XXXX ,   XXXX   to  XXXX ,  XXXX  does n't leave until  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . We will still be here in  XXXX  on the date they have reserved.

I also filed police reports after the Bank of America account closing on him that were not directly related to this issue but the nature is the same. He has a history of doing this to women & I have proof dated prior to me being made aware of the fraud reporting. I told the representative I spoke with I am not interested of filing a new police report months after the fact but I do have reports which show him doing these same thing with my account at another financial institution.

 BofA said the {$190.00} check would be good to cover items that posted on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  . I assumed this would pay for the {$130.00} payment.     I carefully monitor this account. All day on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , there was never any overdraft notice. All day on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , there was no overdraft charge. But, when I returned home from work after  XXXX , in the morning of  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , there was a backdated overdraft notice and charge for {$35.00} on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX   for the {$130.00}.     This seems grossly unfair.  1. I had money in the bank to cover the charge. 2.  The bill was not scheduled to be paid until  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , when my check would have posted.  3.  I was never notified that a payment had posted on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , even though I have every type of alert possible set up for this account, and I monitor my account closely. Had I known that the bill payment had posted on  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX  , I would have immediately withdrawn funds from another bank and covered the payment.     I have asked for a refund of the overdraft charge, bu t BofA  refuses to give it to me. They claim that I should have known that the bank might pay my bills early and not tell me about it!     I do n't think it should be legal for banks to backdate items when backdating causes the consumer to be charged fees. Seems like a sneaky tactic designed to enrich banks. In addition, it should be required that banks notify customers immediately whenever they are overdrawn so that they can put money into the account to cover the overdraft without incurring a fee.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'or', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'deposited', 'a', 'check', 'for', 'nineteen thousand', 'into', 'my', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'checking', 'account', 'via', 'my', 'phone', 'i', 'knew', 'i', 'had', 'a', 'billpay', 'check', 'for', 'thirteen thousand', 'going', 'to', 'a', 'creditor', 'that', 'was', 'scheduled', 'to', 'be', 'paid', 'on', 'xxxx', 'bofa', 'said', 'the', 'nineteen thousand', 'check', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'to', 'cover', 'items', 'that', 'posted', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'assumed', 'this', 'would', 'pay', 'for', 'the', 'thirteen thousand', 'payment', 'i', 'carefully', 'monitor', 'this', 'account', 'all', 'day', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'was', 'never', 'any', 'overdraft', 'notice', 'all', 'day', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'was', 'no', 'overdraft', 'charge', 'but', 'when', 'i', 'returned', 'home', 'from', 'work', 'after', 'xxxx', 'in', 'the', 'morning', 'of', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'there', 'was', 'a', 'backdated', 'overdraft', 'notice', 'and', 'charge', 'for', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'for', 'the', 'thirteen thousand', 'this', 'seems', 'grossly', 'unfair', 'one', 'i', 'had', 'money', 'in', 'the', 'bank', 'to', 'cover', 'the', 'charge', 'two', 'the', 'bill', 'was', 'not', 'scheduled', 'to', 'be', 'paid', 'until', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'when', 'my', 'check', 'would', 'have', 'posted', 'three', 'i', 'was', 'never', 'notified', 'that', 'a', 'payment', 'had', 'posted', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'even', 'though', 'i', 'have', 'every', 'type', 'of', 'alert', 'possible', 'set', 'up', 'for', 'this', 'account', 'and', 'i', 'monitor', 'my', 'account', 'closely', 'had', 'i', 'known', 'that', 'the', 'bill', 'payment', 'had', 'posted', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'immediately', 'withdrawn', 'funds', 'from', 'another', 'bank', 'and', 'covered', 'the', 'payment', 'i', 'have', 'asked', 'for', 'a', 'refund', 'of', 'the', 'overdraft', 'charge', 'bu', 't', 'bofa', 'refuses', 'to', 'give', 'it', 'to', 'me', 'they', 'claim', 'that', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'that', 'the', 'bank', 'might', 'pay', 'my', 'bills', 'early', 'and', 'not', 'tell', 'me', 'about', 'it', 'i', 'do', 'nt', 'think', 'it', 'should', 'be', 'legal', 'for', 'banks', 'to', 'backdate', 'items', 'when', 'backdating', 'causes', 'the', 'consumer', 'to', 'be', 'charged', 'fees', 'seems', 'like', 'a', 'sneaky', 'tactic', 'designed', 'to', 'enrich', 'banks', 'in', 'addition', 'it', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'that', 'banks', 'notify', 'customers', 'immediately', 'whenever', 'they', 'are', 'overdrawn', 'so', 'that', 'they', 'can', 'put', 'money', 'into', 'the', 'account', 'to', 'cover', 'the', 'overdraft', 'without', 'incurring', 'a', 'fee']"

2,18,26,111,"I am a permanent resident of the   US and a customer of Bank Of America for years. Recently I was sent a letter requesting to go to a branch and provide my residency documents. It was then that revealed that my residency status in BoA systems was captured as a US citizen. This change had been made to my account without my knowledge and consent. My status was updated to the original correct citizenship though when I provided my legal documents, and the store manager apologized. He was even surprised how a customer 's citizenship status could be modified in their system like this.
Since this could have unknown legal responsibilities and consequences to the extent I have no idea what, I filed a complaint in the store to receive an official response from BoA on why and when this change had been made to my account. Two weeks later somebody called me and explained they had researched my case, but had no idea when or how this had happened! While she apologized on the call for this hassle, and confirmed this change had nothing to do with me ( how could it ), she refused to supply a written response taking responsibilities for this modification. Again, changing my status from a non-citizen to US citizen, specially considering I am a citizen of a country that is undergoing US sanctions, could have consequences in future that this is my right to know when this happened and why. This could also be a fraud or misconduct of somebody in BoA who had access to customers confidential information like mine.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'am', 'a', 'permanent', 'resident', 'of', 'the', 'us', 'and', 'a', 'customer', 'of', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'for', 'years', 'recently', 'i', 'was', 'sent', 'a', 'letter', 'requesting', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'a', 'branch', 'and', 'provide', 'my', 'residency', 'documents', 'it', 'was', 'then', 'that', 'revealed', 'that', 'my', 'residency', 'status', 'in', 'boa', 'systems', 'was', 'captured', 'as', 'a', 'us', 'citizen', 'this', 'change', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'without', 'my', 'knowledge', 'and', 'consent', 'my', 'status', 'was', 'updated', 'to', 'the', 'original', 'correct', 'citizenship', 'though', 'when', 'i', 'provided', 'my', 'legal', 'documents', 'and', 'the', 'store', 'manager', 'apologized', 'he', 'was', 'even', 'surprised', 'how', 'a', 'customer', 's', 'citizenship', 'status', 'could', 'be', 'modified', 'in', 'their', 'system', 'like', 'this', 'since', 'this', 'could', 'have', 'unknown', 'legal', 'responsibilities', 'and', 'consequences', 'to', 'the', 'extent', 'i', 'have', 'no', 'idea', 'what', 'i', 'filed', 'a', 'complaint', 'in', 'the', 'store', 'to', 'receive', 'an', 'official', 'response', 'from', 'boa', 'on', 'why', 'and', 'when', 'this', 'change', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'somebody', 'called', 'me', 'and', 'explained', 'they', 'had', 'researched', 'my', 'case', 'but', 'had', 'no', 'idea', 'when', 'or', 'how', 'this', 'had', 'happened', 'while', 'she', 'apologized', 'on', 'the', 'call', 'for', 'this', 'hassle', 'and', 'confirmed', 'this', 'change', 'had', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'with', 'me', 'how', 'could', 'it', 'she', 'refused', 'to', 'supply', 'a', 'written', 'response', 'taking', 'responsibilities', 'for', 'this', 'modification', 'again', 'changing', 'my', 'status', 'from', 'a', 'noncitizen', 'to', 'us', 'citizen', 'specially', 'considering', 'i', 'am', 'a', 'citizen', 'of', 'a', 'country', 'that', 'is', 'undergoing', 'us', 'sanctions', 'could', 'have', 'consequences', 'in', 'future', 'that', 'this', 'is', 'my', 'right', 'to', 'know', 'when', 'this', 'happened', 'and', 'why', 'this', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'a', 'fraud', 'or', 'misconduct', 'of', 'somebody', 'in', 'boa', 'who', 'had', 'access', 'to', 'customers', 'confidential', 'information', 'like', 'mine']"

2,5,19,0,"Bank of America sent me balance transfer checks to use up to the credit limit on the account of {$22000.00}. I took advantage of their offer.

They basically relayed that this issue had been reviewed and the bank followed all policies so there was no error on their part.     I strongly disagree. Reporting that can so quickly destroy a very good credit rating so quickly over such an insignificant amount needs to be reviewed and addressed.

1,8,25,80,"I find that the Bank of America online banking website for my   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   card lacks enough basic information in obvious locations to educate consumers on their processes. This practice seems predatory. The statement balance amount and due date are n't automatically populated when you go from Account Overview to the Bill Pay Center tab of the site, which creates an extra step prone to human error while transferring the information from one place to another. The Bill Pay Center tab also does n't provide sufficient information, anywhere, that explains the different between  e-Bill  and  Recurring  Payments. When you try to establish an automatic payment, the website warns you that it takes a complete billing cycle to go into effect. My  XXXX  balance was paid twice (  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX   &  XXXX / XXXX /  XXXX   ) and the latter was my e-bill initiated payment, which I was led to believe would NOT go into effect until it was time to pay my  XXXX    XXXX   statement. The website should provide a warning that my e-bill initiation would cover a specific statement. Consider elderly people, people living paycheck to paycheck, or young credit card holders that can not afford the mistakes that the BOA website seems designed to lead people to make. The mobile application is not much better!

On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , around  XXXX , logged into our personal account. Noticed that in our personal account there was a debit of {$880000.00} coming out of our account. I also attempted to log in to our business account, but was unable to log in. In my attempt to log in was given an error message of No match found. Please create a n ew Online ID and Passcode. We  had previously set up online banking, so this was a surprise to us. I immediately called the banks customer service center, asked about the debit amount coming out of our account and was told that the debit was put there by Bank of America as a way of stopping any further activity. I was then directed to contact th e Risk Closure  Department. Contacted them, was asked to provide my social security number and my Drivers License Number in order to locate my account and for verification purposes. Was told by a Risk Customer Service Representative that my account was under review and was most likely going to be closed. When I asked for the reason behind the closure, was only given the reason that it was a business decision and that we didnt adhere to the provisions of t he Deposit Agreement and   Disclosures and that at any time the owner of the account or the bank had the option to close the account without giving any reason for closure. I asked for more clarification of the closer and was told again that it was a business decision and was not able to give me any more information. Later, went home and rea d the Deposit Agreement and Disclosure again and  was unable to locate or determine any reason behind what was not adhered to within this agreement/disclosure.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  around  XXXX , contacted t he Risk Closure Depar tment to obtain more information on our accounts and if they were going to be closed. In talking to the representative I was under the impression that I was discussing our personal and business accounts. Was told the closure was still under review and that there wasnt much else that could be done at this time. Furthermore, explained that we are a small business starting out and that we are only able to keep money in our account for a short time since we are trying to build our business by buying more products for resale. We dont have the capacity to keep money in our account for a lengthy amount of time. The nature of our business is that we buy our items from auction. At times we find good deals at the last moment, bid on the item, win the auction and make the purchase. We have a short turnaround time to make a payment. We are not like other businesses that purchase product and have 30 days to make a payment. For example there was a cash deposit in to our account and within that same banking day we sent a wire to a company by the name of  XXXX   XXXX , which also has an account with Bank of America, to purchase products that we had won on the auction. We have copies of the receipts for the items we purchased through the auction. If this documentation is needed to assist in this matter, we would be more than happy to provide them to you.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  around  XXXX , contacted t he Risk Closure D epartment and was told that there was no risk closure attached to my social security number. I was under the impression that our personal accounts were not going to be closed.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  around  XXXX , visited the local branch to see if our personal account was still open as well as the business account. I was told that the accounts were still under review, but were not closed. I again, still thought the accounts were going to be okay. After leaving the branch, I went to the ATM machine to withdrawal money and my card had been inactivated. Went back in to the branch and spoke with another representative. This individual noticed the pending risk closure and went to another branch employee to discuss. I was told they were trying to contact the Risk Closure Department to see if I could make a withdrawal and I was told that this department had already closed for the day, this was around  XXXX . This department closes at  XXXX  local time.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  around  XXXX , contacted the  Risk Closure Dep artment to obtain clarification on whether our accounts were actually going to be closed. Was told that they were in fact going to be closed. I again asked for the reason behind the account closure and was given the same response as I received on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX . I was still unable to receive a legitimate detailed reason for the closure. I explained to the representative that if the bank is going to provide the reason for closure of being that the customer didnt adhere to th e Deposit Agreement and Disclosure, that  they should be able to give a specific reason and page number within the agreement/disclosure that was not followed.     We strongly believe that that my spouse 's national origin, owner of the business, might have played a part in their decision to close our accounts. We did not receive an unbiased risk evaluation from Bank of America, due to his national origin. Bank of America was fully aware that the owner of the business had traveled and conducted routine business in  XXXX , which is his national origin.     During this time of not being able to use our accounts, we have suffered operational losses and opportunity costs of not being able to engage in normal planned business activity. This has put an undue stress on the business of not being able to purchase products. This has also put an undue amount of stress on our family, with young children, by not having access to our funds. I have also had to take time off of work to deal with this situation.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['my', 'husband', 'and', 'i', 'opened', 'our', 'personal', 'checking', 'and', 'savings',

0,2,4,28,"I feel that Bank of America committed an act of retaliation in the most obscene and disgusting way possible. On   XX/XX/XXXX ,  I placed a claim of fraud agains t one o f their customers in which I sent a transfer to. By mid   XX/XX/XXXX , th ey were stating that they stopped trying to get the money back. Honestly, I feel like they never tried, so I was out of my money of {$1400.00}. I tried to escalate this to the CEO of the company and apparently this was a huge no-no in their little world. Let me add, that not once have I overdrafted my account. So, here is the deal, today,   XX/XX/XXXX  2017,  m y deposit of almost {$900.00} hit my account for the week. Fortunately, I got gas at the beginning of the day and a few sodas, but by mid-day, on a Friday mind you, they instantly decided to shut down the account. No telephone calls, no emails, no letters in writing, nothing formal and I am left in the dark without a clear idea of what happened. I, then, called the customer service unit and got transferred. When I asked for a clear reason why my account was closed, there was no clear reason of why it happened. I was left completely in the dark. I got served with "" Bank of America has the right to close your account at anytime ''. Well, that is nice, but why must the representatives of the bank be so smug and arrogant about it. This is hardly professional. It is almost like I worked for a week and Bank of America took it upon themselves to say "" Well, we got this scammed out of {$1400.00}, what is anothe r $  XXXX +?  '' "" He can handle it and we do not care if his refrigerator is empty, we do not care if his car payment is coming up due, we do not care if his day to day expenses need to be covered. We just care about  XXXX  this guy over because {$1400.00} was not enough. '' This is deplorable, unethical, and yes, I understand, perfect legal, but how am I to live over the next several days?

Yeah, they are giving me permission to come to the bank in  1 to 3  business days to get my own money. Guess what, Bank of America, THAT IS MY MONEY AND YOU ARE COMMITTING ACTS OF FRAUD AND MONEY LAUNDERING. You are holding my money, loaning on it, gaining a nominal interest rate on it, and doing of ton of interesting things that only banks like you know to do with it and what do I have? Nothing, nada, zilch, and a complete and utter upheaval of life. You have no class and that is unacceptable.

1,8,23,84,"I opened a joint account with my husband over 15 years ago with Bank of America. Subsequently, I developed a  XXXX  that makes it very painful for me to use a voice telephone. As I am not deaf or speech impaired, I do not have a relay service nor equipment to use one. Further, use of a relay service compromises privacy in unacceptable ways. I have previously complained here regarding BoA 's chat portal, where they first said they could n't help me because it "" was n't secure, '' then backtracked on that and found other excuses not to use the portal for assistance.     Despite my opening the account, my husband was listed as primary cardholder, a fact I was not aware of until I tried to get information on transactions several years ago. I attempted to resolve this through use of online chat, but was unsuccessful as BoA refused to discuss the matter or afford solutions using a medium I could communicate with. I requested they escalate to their general counsel and/or  XXXX  coordinator, but nothing ever happened.     This week, I attempted to bring my credit card feed into my accounting program. I found myself unable to either view the credit card information online, or bring over the feed, likely due to not being the primary cardholder despite my opening the account. As BoA now advertised help via  XXXX , I tried that and asked how I could get help either via chat, email, fax,  XXXX ,  XXXX , or any other online means.     Unfortunately, the person answering my query on  XXXX  said BoA had taken down chat, and help would not be available using any of those means. My only recourse is to physically go to a branch. My  XXXX  makes it difficult for me to go to a branch, my work from home job usually encompasses the hours most branches are open, and I feel I should not be penalized for having a  XXXX  by a company that offers its services to the general public.

Payment was not processed by Bank of America until  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX . A late fee of {$25.00} was placed even though full payment was received and made before the due date. No partial payments were made. Called company and spoke with  XXXX   XXXX  to waive {$25.00} since it was the first time this happened, given that she mentioned she was not authorized to make that decision, she transferred me to her  manager   XXXX   XXXX , who reviewed the information in he system and after he verified mentioned that he could not waive the fee.     That Thursday  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  I looked to verify the fee and I noticed that instead of the {$25.00} I had been charged {$27.00} with interest. I called Bank of America again and throw time spoke with  XXXX  from California who did not want to provide her last name. I explained to her the situation and mentioned that I was being charged interest over the late fee and paid {$27.00} to avoid getting paid and interest. She wanted to remove the {$2.00} and did so without my authorization and I told her I would pay at that moment the full amount to avoid being charged more interest. She said I would be charged additional interest at the end of the month. How is this possible? I made the full payment and paid late fee with interest? Not understanding what clause in the contract says this. It is not clear. It seems that because of them proces sing one day late the payment I will need to catch up with them, buy then if I do n't pay they have two days to cha rge me addditonal interest?

Will my interest rate change? The Bank does not make this clear.   Will this affect my  credit score? Will this be reported in the Credit Bureaus?

I did not cash any check at  XXXX . BoA refused to provide me with any additional details such as the date of the transaction, etc. They told me they mailed me a letter and that I should take it up with   XXXX   XXXX  . I then contacted   XXXX   XXXX    (  as did the party who issued the check to me ).  XXXX  conducted and investigation and determined that the check was only negotiated ONCE. To Bank of America. They had absolutely no record or contact BoA nor of the check being used at  XXXX . They offered to speak to BoA to clear the matter up.     I then contacted BoA again who suddenly claimed that   XXXX   XXXX   had nothing to do with it. They claimed that i had deposited the check once by ATM and once via mobile deposit. Again, utterly untrue. Actually, i accidentally deposited the check twice via mobile deposit. The first time i tried, it did not appear to go through ; I deposited the check again and later got  XXXX  confirmations. However, the money was only deposited a single time into my account so there would be no reason to later withdraw it. They supposedly launched an investigation to reapply the funds to my account. They assured me that i would hear back by yesterday. I did not, of course.     I then called them to follow up on the return of my funds, and this time they were back to claiming that it was negotiated at  XXXX . The person I spoke to -  XXXX  - was a complete  moron and  was utterly unhelpful. His suggestion was to have the party write me another check. But the money was never returned to her. And   XXXX   XXXX   claims it was not returned to them. Basically, BoA withdrew funds and send them ... ... who knows? Again, they refused to provide me with any proof that the funds had been used at  XXXX , and they refused to discuss it with   XXXX   XXXX    ( th e bank the check was issued from ).     They no refuse to help me in any way and refuse to provide me with proof the funds were used somewhere else. At this point, i consider this straight up theft, and I intend to contact the police as well as the Attorney General if the funds are not returned immediately with interest.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['bank', 'of', 'america', 'withdrew', 'ninety-one thousand', 'from', 'my', 'account', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'seventeen', 'claiming', 'that', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'had', 'contacted', 'them', 'and', 'stating', 'that', 'the', 'check', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'twice', 'once', 'to', 'mobile', 'deposit', 'and', 'once', 'to', 'xxxx', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'cash', 'any', 'check', 'at', 'xxxx', 'boa', 'refused', 'to', 'provide', 'me', 'with', 'any', 'additional', 'details', 'such', 'as', 'the', 'date', 'of', 'the', 'transaction', 'etc', 'they', 'told', 'me', 'they', 'mailed', 'me', 'a', 'letter', 'and', 'that', 'i', 'should', 'take', 'it', 'up', 'with', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'then', 'contacted', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'as', 'did', 'the', 'party', 'who', 'issued', 'the', 'check', 'to', 'me', 'xxxx', 'conducted', 'and', 'investigation', 'and', 'determined', 'that', 'the', 'check', 'was', 'only', 'negotiated', 'once', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'they', 'had', 'absolutely', 'no', 'record', 'or', 'contact', 'boa', 'nor', 'of', 'the', 'check', 'being', 'used', 'at', 'xxxx', 'they', 'offered', 'to', 'speak', 'to', 'boa', 'to', 'clear', 'the', 'matter', 'up', 'i', 'then', 'contacted', 'boa', 'again', 'who', 'suddenly', 'claimed', 'that', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'had', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'with', 'it', 'they', 'claimed', 'that', 'i', 'had', 'deposited', 'the', 'check', 'once', 'by', 'atm', 'and', 'once', 'via', 'mobile', 'deposit', 'again', 'utterly', 'untrue', 'actually', 'i', 'accidentally', 'deposited', 'the', 'check', 'twice', 'via', 'mobile', 'deposit', 'the', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'tried', 'it', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'to', 'go', 'through', 'i', 'deposited', 'the', 'check', 'again', 'and', 'later', 'got', 'xxxx', 'confirmations', 'however', 'the', 'money', 'was', 'only', 'deposited', 'a', 'single', 'time', 'into', 'my', 'account', 'so', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'reason', 'to', 'later', 'withdraw', 'it', 'they', 'supposedly', 'launched', 'an', 'investigation', 'to', 'reapply', 'the', 'funds', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'they', 'assured', 'me', 'that', 'i', 'would', 'hear', 'back', 'by', 'yesterday', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'of', 'course', 'i', 'then', 'called', 'them', 'to', 'follow', 'up', 'on', 'the', 'return', 'of', 'my', 'funds', 'and', 'this', 'time', 'they', 'were', 'back', 'to', 'claiming', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'negotiated', 'at', 'xxxx', 'the', 'person', 'i', 'spoke', 'to', 'xxxx', 'was', 'a', 'complete', 'moron', 'and', 'was', 'utterly', 'unhelpful', 'his', 'suggestion', 'was', 'to', 'have', 'the', 'party', 'write', 'me', 'another', 'check', 'but', 'the', 'money', 'was', 'never', 'returned', 'to', 'her', 'and', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'claims', 'it', 'was', 'not', 'returned', 'to', 'them', 'basically', 'boa', 'withdrew', 'funds', 'and', 'send', 'them', 'who', 'knows', 'again', 'they', 'refused', 'to', 'provide', 'me', 'with', 'any', 'proof', 'that', 'the', 'funds', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'at', 'xxxx', 'and', 'they', 'refused', 'to', 'discuss', 'it', 'with', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'th', 'e', 'bank', 'the', 'check', 'was', 'issued', 'from', 'they', 'no', 'refuse', 'to', 'help', 'me', 'in', 'any', 'way', 'and', 'refuse', 'to', 'provide', 'me', 'with', 'proof', 'the', 'funds', 'were', 'used', 'somewhere', 'else', 'at', 'this', 'point', 'i', 'consider', 'this', 'straight', 'up', 'theft', 'and', 'i', 'intend', 'to', 'contact', 'the', 'police', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'attorney', 'general', 'if', 'the', 'funds', 'are', 'not', 'returned', 'immediately', 'with', 'interest']"
0,2,20,23,"Most recent incident date :  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  Financial Institution : Bank of America and the  XXXX   XXXX . branch in  XXXX , NC Employees involved :  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX   XXXX   (   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ) Horrible Cu stomer Service, Inconsistencies and Discrimination I have been a customer of Bank of America since  XXXX . I have been treated unfairly and inconsistently by branch employees and managers. I feel that I am being discriminated against and humiliated by branch employees inside the branches when I attempt to cash, deposit and seek to access funds from a payroll check. I have been cashing and depositing these checks from the same employer, ever y two weeks, for over one and a half yea rs, to date. Never has one check from this employer been dishonored, in my account. My check is typically never more than {$1000.00}. Nonetheless, I am given the option to deposit it and I have been refused the right to access even a minimal dollar amount upon depositing or attempting to cash my check. I have written complaints through surveys, written correspondence, and email to the corporate offices and the discrimination and unfair treatment still continues.     I have been discriminated against and treated in a very unprofessional and at times threatening manner. Often, I receive d iffering and conflicting information from the customer care center and branch employees. Branch employees h ave been denying me the right to funds earned and consistently deposited and cashed at the banks for over one and half years has caused many humiliating negative experiences in front of other customers and bank employees. There have been multiple incidences of intimidation and harassment that I have endured as a result of opting to bank with Bank of America, inside their  XXXX  branches.     The most recent experience happened today,  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX . I called the customer care center on  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  at abou t    XXXX   XXXX   to request a stop payment from a company that was drafting my account. The B of A customer care representative explained that I would have to pay  two  {$30.00} fees ( that were drafted from my account shortly after the call ) to ensure the stop payment happened, and I agreed. However, the draft still took place on the  XXXX  of  XXXX ,  ( 5 ) da ys after the call, and it caused the account to overdraft as I had other purchases and drafts taking place. The representative also encouraged me to take out any needed funds prior to the  XXXX  to ensure that they would not be usurped through or by NSF fees and the draft that could still go through, in spite of, the Stop payment request and the fees associated and paid.     At that time, I explained to the rep that I would be getting paid on the  XXXX  and that I would need access to the paycheck funds and that I would need to cash the check at the time of the call my account had at least {$700.00}. My concern was, would the NSF and  Stop  payment transaction cause my account to be in the negative? Would that occurrence, in turn, cause more harassment and humiliation for me when I made an effort to cash the check on the  XXXX . He assured me multiple times that I would have no problem, as the branch would consider the stop payment request and fees paid and honor the paycheck that I cash with Bank of Americ a ( every two we eks for the past year and a half ). He also assured me that any NSF fees charged to my account, as a result of the draft going through, ( in spite of the Stop payment request and fees ) would be credited back to my account without a problem.     Because of previous humiliating experiences, I did not attempt to enter the branch or do anything with the check on pay day. I held the check and waited to enter the branch on  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX , simply out of fear of any further embarrassment or incident, as a result of the, branch employees turning me away and refusing to cash or provide access to my paycheck funds. Upon entering the  XXXX   XXXX  branch on  XXXX   XXXX . in  XXXX , NC, there were  only 3 ba nk employees visible to customers. No one was present to greet customers and direct them to the right area or explain the process to meet with a bank  officer. One  male was in the office staring at his computer, even though someone was waiting to be seen and sitting in the red chairs. I initially attempted to get in the teller line, then changed my mind and went over toward the red chairs, with hopes to ask my questions in a more confidential setting.  XXXX   XXXX  was at the teller desk. He was extremely rude and unprofessional, he did not greet me or explain the process required to meet with a branch member in the offices. He just raised his voice and in an irritated tone, in front of all customers and employees, then verbally summoned me to his window, as I tried to make my way to the chairs and wait for someone in the office to help me with my questions. He yelled, "" I can not hear you behind this glass. '' He was so visibly frustrated and annoyed that a customer, at the other teller window, talking to the other female teller, jumped in the conversation and began trying to explain to me that  XXXX  was saying that he wanted to have me sign in at the teller window, before sitting down, to meet a bank officer. Without explaining the process,  XXXX   XXXX  required that I give him my debit card and then asked what was the reason I needed to speak to an office employee. I told him I had questions about my account and I can only assume he put my information in the system as he began typing. He put my card back under the teller window and gave no other comment or directive. He did not say someone will be happy to help you in a moment or please have a seat or anything to expalin the process. He did say the gentleman in the red chairs is already waiting.     After a few minutes,  XXXX   XXXX  came out of the office and straight to me, not to the man who had been waiting. I told him that  XXXX   XXXX  had mentioned the other guy was before me. It was obvious that their system and communication was inconsistent, because he did not have the man 's information or even know that the man waiting was there before me. When I met with  XXXX   XXXX  who was very polite, but seemed to more concerned about whether or not I still worked for a certain company that he had obviously seen noted on my account info. He was also more curious about who I work now, than he was about really listening and providing resolve for my concerns. I explained the entire situation and the promises from the customer care center. I also expressed the need to be able to access funds from my paycheck, even though the account was now, in the negative status. I also wanted information on why, as of  XXXX   XXXX , and after the stop payment fees had been deducted, the draft still happened from the company I had requested stop payment for. He said that he would try and find out answers after explaining that he was more in the role of a Merrill Lynch adviser. He left to go talk to  XXXX   XXXX  and he literally came back to me and said, that he was told that I ""  may or may  not '' be able to cash the check or have access to any of the funds. He said that he "" was told we would not know, until you go in the teller line to submit the check. '' When I did,  XXXX   XXXX  immediately said that the system would not allow me to cash the check due to the negative balance, but that I could deposit it to clear the negative balance. So, I asked if the stop payment and fees were explained to him, he said, "" No. '' I then asked if he could see them, as the customer care center rep had advised, but  XXXX   XXXX  said that from his teller screen he could not see any of those things. I also asked him that if I deposited the check, would I be able to at least have access to minimal funds today? He said typically minimal access would be {$200.00} but because my account was negative {$200.00} plus dollars, that I could not have access to anything. He said that I would have to deposit the check and wait for the bank to release the funds in a couple of days. He was very dismissive and the conversation was again humiliating, as it was in front of other customers and employees.     I left and went to my car to call  XXXX   XXXX , the Regional Manager, who had provided his number and asked me to call him if I was ever denied access to funds from the same payroll check again or if I ever felt I was treated unfairly in any of his branches. I had a previous conversation with him after being treated in a threatening and humiliating manner in the branch at  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  by a branch employees who happened to be in the branch  manager  's stead on that day. He was very aggressive, intimidating and rude to me in the parking lot and subsequently, in the actual branch. In that situation  XXXX   XXXX  apologized and tried to provide resolve even though he admitted that this particular employees had been the subject of similar complaints from other customers.      XXXX   XXXX  was clearly annoyed by the call today, however and obviously, too busy to hear my concerns and experience. He said that he would call the branch to find out what was going on. He called me back and stated that my only option was to deposit my check, as the account was in negative status. He talked over me as I tried to explain the details of the situation and told me to go back into the bank and he would have someone explain to me why I would not be able to have access to any funds, much less cash my check while it was in a negative status, even if there was a stop payment request and the fees had already been deducted from my account.     When I walked in the branch, I was again, greeted by no one, I walked to the chairs and saw  XXXX   XXXX  talking to a female employee. Eventually,  XXXX   XXXX  approached me by saying, "" Come on into the back ''. She never introduced herself or asked for my name or even said hello. Her badge was not visible the entire time. She never said I am happy to help you or try and explain things to you, She was extremely rude and demeaning. While in the back office with her, she talked down to me, rolled her eyes often and treated me like I was incompetent. It was clear that she could care less about my situation and she made sure her lack of concern was evident in her tone and facial expressions. At times when she talked, I interjected to provide clarity and she basically said, Are you going to let me speak? She made it clear that this was not going to be a conversation and that if i was expecting a change in what had already been conveyed, it would not happen at that branch and especially not with her. I tried to explained that I was confused and had multiple questions about conflicting information provided and eventually,  XXXX   XXXX  literally stopped talking and responding to my questions. She refused to speak or respond after she told me I had made a transaction  aft    XXXX   XXXX   on Monday morning. I explained that I had not made any transaction at that time and I frantically started looking up the email confirmation on my phone. My phone made noise when I accidentally touched the volume button and she in a very demeaning tone said, "" Am I to assume that I am now being recorded? You do not have my consent to record this conversation. '' She  was ( extremely ),  confrontational and I was very uncomfortable being back in that area alone with her. She felt comfortable not providing resolve for me, being dismissive and out right unprofessional and rude throughout the entire interaction. I explained that I would not record anyone without letting them know and that I was simply on the phone to look up the actual times for the transactions. She was not helpful and did not provide good customer service. I was more confused and humiliated after meeting with her. I had no way of knowing what she was referring to regarding transactions  at    XXXX   XXXX  . I knew I had not made them, so I was also afraid there  may have been fraud. She provided no resolve. She did say, "" the last thing I will do, is print off the transactions and you can go review them. '' When I left her office, she did not say  anything, not even goodbye.     When I left the branch, I drove home and I called customer care. I spoke to a lady named,  XXXX , and thankfully, she stayed on the phone with me until I drove to another bank ATM. She then asked me to proceed to deposit the check, and released access to {$190.00}. She explained the draft that happened in spite of the stop payment request would be removed and that the remaining {$700.0 0} ( or so ) would  be available to me in the morning. She was very empathetic and she actually made an effort to provide some resolve after the discrimination and humiliation I experienced in the  XXXX   XXXX  branch. She apologized for the entire experience and thanked me for being a valued customer since  XXXX . While I was grateful for her, why should I have endured or encountered the discrimination and unfair treatment tha t I contin ue to receive from branch employees?     I was still charged a {$35.00} NSF fee and even though the funds were deposited in my account by me in cash totaling at least {$260.00}, on the  XXXX , I am being told that because I made a transfer between Band  of America acc ounts for {$22.00}, I would have to pay the NSF fees, even in spite of, the stop payment and promises from the initial customer care rep on  XXXX   XXXX . They literally charged me an NSF after allowing me to transfer the {$22.00} that was available in my account, to ANOTHER Bank of America account. If I did not have sufficient funds, then why did the system even allow the transfer???     What if I had a bill due today? Have I not worked and earned a right to the funds paid me by my employer? If the banking center could allow access to less than {$200.00} of the paycheck funds, and allow access to minimal dollars, why did the branch refuse to? Why are there so many inconsistencies? And is so much frustration and mistreatment of customer allowed? Why is Bank of America not held accountable for the discrimination and POOR customer service? However trivial the account balance or the customer, in the employees eyes, or the customer concerns, the institution 's employees should be held accountable for discrimination of any kind and required to treat all customers equally and deliver outstanding customer service to all account holders.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['most', 'recent', 'incident', 'date', 'xxxx',

When I contacted them, they told me I had to speak to the law firm who put the restraint on my account. I contacted them and they told me they had a judgment against me, but I didnt know anything about it.     I went to a free clinic at the court and they looked up the case, but there was no judgment. They referred me to an attorney. The attorney told me that under state law, the bank has to send me forms asking if there is any income in the account that is exempt from collection when they are asked to restrain the account. The Bank never sent me this form, and some of the money in the account is exempt under state law. My attorney contacted the law firm and found out that there was a judgment against me in a different case, and when we checked the court file, we found out that the reason I didnt know about the case was because they had served me at the wrong address. My attorney is asking the court to vacate the default judgment, but because that can take a while, she also contacted the Bank and the creditors law firm to ask them to release my exempt funds from my account.     The bank refused to speak to her and said that they would only speak to her if I was on the line with her every time she called to give them authorization to speak to me, even though I had already given my attorney written authorization. I have  XXXX  and have been undergoing  XXXX  treatment for my neck. It leaves me very tired and affects my ability to speak. I had saved up the money in my account to live on while I was getting treatment, since I would not be able to work because it makes me weak.     Although they would not speak to my lawyer about my specific problem, they told her that they always send out exemption forms and if a customer calls them and says they did not receive it, they send it out again. The bank has my correct address, so if they mailed it to me, I should have gotten it. Because the bank refused to speak to her, the attorney sent them a letter with a copy of a retainer from me and explained to them that they had not complied with state law and that they needed to send me the exemption form and to release the funds that are automatically exempt under state law.

3,12,7,39,"On or about XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX purchased the residential real property located at XXXX, Arizona XXXX ( the "" Property '' ), a single-family residence of less than 2.5 acres, used as a dwelling, for {$120000.00}. ( See XXXX County Assessor 's Office Printout reflecting that the Property is a XXXX square foot residence. ) The XXXX financed the purchase of the Property with two mortgages from Countrywide Home Loans , Inc. ( "" Countrywide '' ) totaling {$100000.00} ( the "" First Mortgage '' ), and {$18000.00} ( the "" Second Mortgage '' ) ( collectively the "" Mortgages '' ). ( See Deed of Trust, recorded in the XXXX County Recorder 's Office on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at document number XXXX, and Deed of Trust, recorded in the XXXX County Recorder 's Office on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at document number XXXX, BOA acquired Countrywide in or about XXXX, thereby acquiring the Mortgages. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the Property was sold in a trustee 's sale, with a bid from a third party purchaser. ( See Trustee 's Deed recorded in the XXXX County Recorder 's Office on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as document number XXXX. BOA has wrongfully misrepresented to the XXXX that they remain obligated on the Mortgages and has pursued further collection of the Mortgages from the XXXX. In fact, the XXXX have learned that, despite the trustee 's sale of the Property on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, BOA has wrongfully continued to report to the XXXX credit bureaus that the Second Mortgage is active and delinquent. 
Simply put, under long-standing Arizona law, the XXXX have no personal liability on the Mortgages, and BOA has no legal right whatsoever to collect, or to pursue collection, of any further sums from the XXXX. Pursuant to Arizona law, the borrower under a purchase-money mortgage secured by a single-family home on 2.S acres or less that is limited to and utilized for a single onefamily dwelling can not be held liable for a deficiency ( a ) following a trustee 's sale ; ( b ) in an action on the note ( regardless whether a trustee 's sale has occurred ) ; or ( c ) in a judicial foreclosure action. 
Here, because the Mortgage was used to purchase the Property, the Property is 2.5 acres or less, the Property is limited to and utilized as a single one-family dwelling, and the Property was sold in a trustee 's sale, BO A 's sole source of recovery on the Mortgage -- the Property -- has been extinguished. BOA, thus, has no legal right whatsoever to seek collection of the balance owing on the Mortgage from the XXXX ' remaining "" assets ''. 
More specifically, A.R.S. XXXX ( G ) provides, in pertinent part, as follows : If trust property of two and one-half acres or less which is limited to and utilized for either a single one-family or single two-family dwelling is sold pursuant to the trustee 's power of sale, no action may be maintained to recover any difference between the amount obtained by sale and the amount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses. Thus, a single-family home on 2.5 acres or less that is limited to and utilized for a single onefamily dwelling qualifies for anti-deficiency protection pursuant to A.R.S. XXXX ( XXXX ). 
Here, as discussed above, the Property is less than 2.5 acres and is utilized as a single onefamily dwelling. Thus, the home constitutes Qualified Property. Further, as discussed above, the Mortgages were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Property. Thus, the Mortgages constitute Purchase Money Mortgages secured by Qualifying Property. As a result, A.R.S. XXXX XXXX ( A ) and XXXX I XXXX ( G ) patently apply to the Mortgages to "" obliterate '' any personal liability of the XXXX on the Mortgages. Since the date of the trustee 's sale BOA has consistently misrepresented to the credit reporting agencies that the Second Mortgage remains an obligation for which the XXXX are liable and delinquent.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'or', 'about', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'the', 'xxxx', 'purchased', 'the', 'residential', 'real', 'property', 'located', 'at', 'xxxx',

Banks have used predatory lending in a mortgage ( from its inception ), and denied the consumer remedy to a complete and accurate investigation in regards to a void mortgage and illegally forged [ robo-signed ] foreclosure instruments, which caused a void lien to property. 

On behalf the consumer I offer this affidavit and notice to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in regards to your client XXXX activities in association with BANA and XXXX. XXXX XXXX, the following issues demonstrate that your client in association with these financial entities have condemned and denied the consumer remedy and a review of ALL documents ( proof of claims ) subject to public access, despite requests for validation of the debt and to certify all parties ' foreclosure activities. 

The mortgage origination of AWL and the servicing of BANA, in association with CWHL and the claims made by XXXX assignment, and the foreclosure sale held by your client by and through the debt collection agencies ' and any other unknown third parties are moot and without good point. 

The consumer has provided through the CFPB portal : The Mortgage/Note is void because the alleged Lender AWL, stated in the mortgage/note to be a New York Corporation, and was not in fact incorporated XX/XX/XXXX or subsequently, at any time, by either CWHL, or BANA, or any of their related corporate entities or agents. '' As "" debt collectors '', the financial entities and several other debt collection agencies refused, despite the consumer 's request, pursuant to the FDCPA to verify their debt collection activities. 

A history of his Petition for Writ of Certiorari [ Case No. XXXX ] - U.S. Supreme Court The 10 year statute of limitation for the collection of debt has expired XX/XX/XXXX and the debt is too old to be sued on. 

Information that, XXXX and associated debt collection agencies ', can not provide evidence of the Lender 's AWL written assignment to XXXX or certify they examined the assignment for an illegally [ ROBO-SIGNED ] forged signature. 

An enormous amount of information to refute XXXX activity in association with BANA ; AWL ; CWHL ; and XXXX. 

His administrative defaults should help to reduce any arguments by showing the records of the financial entities and the debt collection agencies ' reflect they failed in their lawful duty to respond and to provide all damages and injuries caused to any of the related corporate entities or their agents. '' The consumer wishes to inform you XXXX XXXX, he does not intend to dishonor your offer, and conditionally accepts that you and your client are not duty bound and do not encompass the authority to take any further action on this matter by law ; and upon conditionally accepting your offer he proposes that you provide your written and signed Proof of Claim under penalties of perjury, that you and your client et al are not subject to Federal Law and the powers of the CFPB and the OCC both which have jurisdiction over the following : Mortgage origination examination procedures Mortgage servicing examination procedures RESPA procedures Amicus program Warning letters Payments to harmed consumers Supervision and examinations The CFPB Supervision and Examination Manual Failure to provide your written and signed Proof of Claim under penalties of perjury to the consumer will deem your claims again, irrelevant and meritless.

3,3,11,5,"I am at the trial phase of a debt collection case filed by XXXX XXXX XXXX that is using a debit collection attorney to represent them. The account was issued XXXX different account numbers during the life of the account. The fourth account number is the charged off number. The account was opened in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was charged off in XXXX XXXX. They do not have the last XXXX numbers to the account for first 21 months of the account. When I brought this up at XXXX of the hearings, we are going on our third trial date, the plaintiffs attorney was completely surprised. I am representing myself at trial and I am not doing a very good job what so ever. But what I do know for a fact that if a party files a motion for any reason that motion is to be sent to the other party so they may object to the motion. The plaintiffs attorney had disclosed in its list of trial witnesses a person whom is the custodian of records c/o XXXX stating '' this witness will testify as to the assignment of the debt, the amount currently due and owing, and to as to all correspondence or communication between plaintiff and defendant regarding this debt. Plaintiff hereby gives notice that this witness 's testimony may reference documents that are records of regular conduct activity pursuant to rules 803 ( 6 ), 807, and 902 ( 11 ) of the Arizona rules of evidence. Please direct any communication for this witness to Plaintiff 's counsel. '' There was an affidavit from this person stating that "" the seller of the account warranted the account to plaintiff at the time of the assignment and based on that warranty, plaintiff gave defendant written notice of the amount at or about the time of the assignment. '' This statement is completely false and I will bring it to the attention of the court. The Plaintiffs attorney never sent me the Motion it field with the court requesting a telephonic witness testimony of this witness. I brought this up at trial and was ignored. I happened to stumble over the recent Consent Order issued by cfpb against XXXX XXXX XXXX and after review I recognized several of the issues described, like paragraph XXXX that were in violation were taking place in and during my case and trial. I am going to bring the Consent Order to the attention of the judge at my trial date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have a question, when doing so and clearly proving that XXXX is violating the Consent Order is that grounds for the case to be dismissed.I checked off attempted to collect wrong amount because I have been included in a couple of class action settlements against FIA Card Services and was given a pro rated amount which would make the amount uncertain to collect. I have admitted to the court that this was my debt how could I not.Before the debt was charged off the original creditor offered me in a letter stating if I would pay XXXX by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX it would not charge off the debt. I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX but they posted the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and charged off the account anyways. I hope that my issues will not be considered frivolous. The problem with the justice system is consumers are in the predicament because of financial difficulty so they can not hire attorneys to represent them. If a court appointed attorney could be appointed just for observation to the trial proceedings it would be of great help in preventing a consumer from losing the case because they did not present there case correctly.

3,3,7,39,"XXXX, XXXX & XXXX ( XXXX ), on behalf of FIA Card Services ( FIA XXXX, filed a Complaint against me personally on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, on a business debt of {$20000.00} for a defunct LLC of which I was a member. During the litigation, I discovered that FIA did not retain XXXX. Rather, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) did. Since XXXX is domiciled and licensed to practice law in XXXX, it retained XXXX to do its dirty work. Because FIA was not XXXX client, XXXX stonewalled my discovery efforts and would not produce the records I requested which would conclusively demonstrate that this account was not a personal debt. In spite of that, FIA could not prevail when it filed its motion for summary judgment. The court found that the affidavit filed was deficient. Subsequently, FIA made a settlement offer where it would dismiss the Complaint with prejudice and XXXX assured me that FIA would remove the derogatory reporting with all three major credit reporting agencies. Also, I knew that a dismissal with prejudice would require FIA to discontinue the reporting in accordance with the FCRA. The court entered the Agreed Order on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

About a month later, I figured that FIA would have stopped reporting on this account and I viewed my credit report with all three agencies. FIA was continuing with the derogatory reporting. I disputed the entries for three months. Each time, the credit reporting agencies confirmed the entries. I sent an e-mail to XXXX XXXX, XXXX attorney whom I had dealt with on this issue. He responded that he would contact his client. Thirty days later, I checked my credit reports and the reports were continuing. I got back with XXXX XXXX again. He said that he was waiting for his client to get back with him. This happened for another three months, at which time I decided that XXXX XXXX would do nothing about this violation of the FCRA. 

Because I already knew that FIA was really XXXX client, I called XXXX in XXXX XXXX. They committed to get back with me within three days. A day later, I received an e-mail from XXXX XXXX telling me that his client just got back with him and he would send me an agreement to sign, then FIA would stop reporting. I told him that I had n't developed XXXX and he should acknowledge that his client got back to him only because I contacted XXXX. I told him that I hoped there is no clause that would cause FIA to issue me a XXXX the following XXXX. XXXX XXXX, the attorney, conveniently became incompetent. He said that all he knows is that if I sign the agreement, the reporting would end even though I knew that the Agreed Order robs FIA of the benefit of reporting because of the FCRA. 

Sure enough, not only did the agreement allow FIA to issue a XXXX to me, FIA in fact issued that XXXX in XXXX XXXX. How can a debt that does not exist be cancelled? I went back to XXXX again. They told me to contact FIA regarding the XXXX and XXXX regarding everything else. I contacted FIA. They told me that XXXX is their lawyer and is the only party that can resolve this issue. I do n't know who is whose client or who the real lawyer is. Because XXXX XXXX was having problems navigating this issue, he elicited the assistance of a partner at XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX and XXXX disclosed that XXXX was not licensed to practice law in Kentucky and would like to help resolve the issue if I was agreeable to it. I was. I demanded that the XXXX be withdrawn or FIA reimburse me for my tax liability associated with filing the XXXX. I computed the value of the tax due attributable to the XXXX to be {$5800.00} ( Federal ) and {$1100.00} ( state ). XXXX dragged out this issue for months and eventually offered me {$5000.00} to sign the agreement. I declined it in XXXX XXXX. I disputed the XXXX when I filed my tax return.

3,3,7,39,"I opened a business in XXXX with another person. At that time we opened up a number of business accounts with vendors and banks. In XXXX I left the business and sold my ownership to my business partner. We provided all of our vendors and banks with our documents showing the business ownership changes. I requested that all of the cards in my name be closed and closed the credit line that was in our joint names. 

My old partner continued to operate the business till XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX time frame. During that time he apparently racked up debt he could not afford and he started receiving collection notices. I received XXXX from Bank of America at that time in my name. I contacted Bank of America and provided them with my change of ownership documentation and the lady I spoke with claimed to update the account and never contacted me again. In XXXX I ran my credit report and saw a collection agency was listed trying to collect on the old Bank of America debt. I called the company, explained the situation, and they stated that when Bank of America sold them the debt they only listed my name on the account and not my old partners. I was able to get my old partner to contact the collection agency and agree to pay the debt. I provided the collection agency all of the ownership change forms at the time and they never contacted me again. 

My partner never paid the debt and when I attempted to get a mortgage recently I saw that the debt was still on my account. I contacted the collection company, XXXX XXXX and they said that they would not remove me off of the account because that is how they purchased it. I requested that they contact Bank of America to get updated records because my partner should have been the personal guarantor and they would not do it. They said I had to get Bank of America to provide me that documentation. I called Bank of America to request details on the account. Bank of America said they can see that my partner is a personal guarantor and they have notes in their system that there was an ownership request documented but they do n't have any additional details. They do n't have copies of the change of ownership forms I sent in nor copies of the contract stating I am no longer responsible for the business. They are going to provide me with a letter stating that my partner is a personal guarantor but will not provide me with anything stating that I am not. 

I have also requested documentation from XXXX XXXX and Bank of America, verification of what the debt is. I was not with the company during the years that the debt was incurred so I have no idea what they believe I am responsible for. Neither XXXX XXXX nor Bank of America has been able to provide me with any account statements stating who used the account, what was purchased, whose card was being used and in what amounts. I have received nothing from them.

Any help you can give in this matter would be greatly appreciated.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['xxxx', 'xxxx', 'sued', 'me', 'over', 'a', 'disputed', 'debt', 'that', 'they', 'claim', 'i', 'owe', 'to', 'them', 'via', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'na', 'they', 'did', 'let', 'me', 'know', 'about', 'the', 'suit', 'i', 'responded', 'pro', 'se', 'with', 'and', 'answer', 'and', 'counterclaim', 'xxxxxxxx', 'they', 'won', 'a', 'summary', 'judgment', 'against', 'me', 'based', 'on', 'my', 'not', 'answering', 'their', 'requests', 'during', 'discovery', 'i', 'could', 'nt', 'afford', 'an', 'attorney', 'could', 'keep', 'up', 'got', 'lost', 'in', 'the', 'legalese', 'based', 'on', 'the', 'judgement', 'for', 'over', 'xxxx', 'they', 'are', 'trying', 'to', 'garnishee', 'my', 'wages', 'while', 'preparing', 'to', 'challenge', 'that', 'i', 'stumbled', 'across', 'your', 'website', 'and', 'the', 'xxxxxxxx', 'court', 'stipulation', 'directing', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'how', 'to', 'proceed', 'in', 'my', 'case', 'they', 'have', 'violated', 'that', 'agreement', 'in', 'my', 'case', 'they', 'are', 'still', 'one', 'intimidating', 'consumers', 'with', 'deceptive', 'court', 'filings', 'two', 'introducing', 'faulty', 'or', 'unsubstantiated', 'evidence', 'in', 'my', 'case', 'they', 'only', 'had', 'to', 'wellworn', 'photocopies', 'of', 'checks', 'that', 'i', 'd', 'written', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'american', 'not', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'na', 'there', 'was', 'also', 'nothing', 'to', 'show', 'the', 'chain', 'of', 'title', 'from', 'the', 'purported', 'original', 'debt', 'holder', 'to', 'xxxx', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'na', 'the', 'statute', 'of', 'limitations', 'on', 'debt', 'accounts', 'is', 'four', 'years', 'and', 'six', 'years', 'on', 'written', 'contracts', 'this', 'action', 'was', 'filed', 'against', 'me', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'and', 'the', 'order', 'rendered', 'xxxxxxxx', 'both', 'of', 'these', 'were', 'beyond', 'the', 'four', 'or', 'six', 'years', 'after', 'i', 'had', 'severed', 'my', 'relationship', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'i', 'also', 'believe', 'that', 'the', 'attorneys', 'have', 'become', 'judgment', 'collectors', 'and', 'as', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'continuation', 'of', 'their', 'illadvised', 'and', 'illegal', 'practices', 'i', 'have', 'a', 'hearing', 'in', 'the', 'morning', 'about', 'garnishment', 'of', 'my', 'wages', 'based', 'on', 'this', 'bogus', 'judgment', 'awarded', 'based', 'on', 'procedure', 'and', 'not', 'on', 'evidence', 'i', 'm', 'now', 'trying', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'summary', 'judgment', 'set', 'aside', 'again', 'as', 'prose', 'still', 'ca', 'nt', 'afford', 'an', 'attorney', 'so', 'that', 'they', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'to', 'prove', 'their', 'allegations', 'and', 'to', 'conform', 'to', 'the', 'xxxxxxxx', 'consent', 'decree', 'signed', 'by', 'federal', 'judge', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'any', 'help', 'you', 'can', 'give', 'in', 'this', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'appreciated']"
3,3,10,72,"I received a letter today from XXXX XXXX, regarding CFPB complaint XXXX. I called ( XXXX ) XXXX, extension XXXX, and as always with all previous debt collection by BOA, no one actually answers these phone numbers. These letters are fake attempts to resolve complaints and are blatant attempts to collect a debt using "" we are a debt collector '' on the voicemail. As such, and since no debt is owed, I am instead writing yet another CFPB complaint to address what is so very wrong with the letter I received. First of all, this sentence is at issue : : '' We are able to confirm that there has been no avtivity on the closed account following these transactions '' in XX/XX/XXXX. That is not what the fraud department at XXXX and XXXX told me! After receiving the initial hardcopy of my free report around XX/XX/XXXX in COLOR it losts 13 monthly payments on time. So it was verified in print and by phone that BOA did in fact report it. Yet the letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX enclosed inside this envelope today by XXXX, says, "" Bank of America conducted an internal technology upgrade in XXXX XXXX, which resulted in an update to the national credit reporting agencies ... determined no bank error ... '' That is a lie. That is not what was printed on my hardcopy from XXXX when I called BOA on XXXX XXXX XXXX to tell them fraud had been committed by a bank employee and it is not what XXXX XXXX at XXXX fraud department told me either. None of the evidence agrees with what BOA keeps saying, falsely. Either BOA or BOA 's servicer posed as the bank to firnish false payment history which ca n't be explained by the XXXX XXXX date, since it FOLLOWS a years ' worth of payments that happened prior to the cited computer entry. XXXX cited a XXXX date. Each credit reporting agency cites different reporting at different times and in different ways pronts it on each of the XXXX reports. BOA also persists on looking at edited reports to find answers to their internal furnished data. It is not there. Some of the credit reports have since removed it because it is time-barred after XX/XX/XXXX. This is XX/XX/XXXX!!!!!!!!!! Ridiculous! All of this energy and resources to uphold erroneous data furnishing to XXXX credit reporting agencies on a debt that had XXXX value since XXXX defies logic and reason!!!!! Clearly the SEC should unvestigate BOA to see how many such "" assets '' are on the banks books to trick investors into thinking cash flow is generated when none was generated. There would be no other sensible reason to keep in place an account closed half a decade before BOA allegedly acquired it and which was a worthless asset "" dead on arrival '' asset that has generated XXXX income and yet had wasted many resources by the bank to deny they falsely reported it as I say they have. The facts are in my side. BOA ca n't manufacture fake documents and fake computer upgrades which are wholly inconsistemt with the printed records and expect any court in America to think fraud has not been committed. Recently, a whistleblower case at the headquarters where this envelope was mailed - OH wait! where it was pretending to be mailed XXXX different zip codes : XXXX in NC and the XXXX XXXX meter at zip code XXXX in FL just adds to the deception! The letterhead adds to the deception with "" Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC XXXX '' where the whistleblower works. I filed my many complaints long before the whistleblower case hit the headlinrs but all I read about it this month reaffirms my own complaints. I contacted that attorney to add information. BOA has not been honest with me not the creditvreporting agencies. There was no reason whatsoever to update a closed account from XXXX nor should it have ever been added to BOA 's computer database at any point in time. All that BOA is making abundantky evident it lies.

3,3,10,72,"I XXXX makes a claim with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) that the following attached attempt to collect a debt is highly fraudulent. My personal information is being floated in what is known in the debt collection business as a "" Debt Pool '', whereas collection information is outdated and not even enforceable. The attached collection from XXXX does not state that the debt is no longer enforceable, a stipulation by the Federal Trade Commission. The method of an illegal posting of a collection on my personal credit report, or an illegal collection against my rights of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can not be tolerated. In Federal Trade Commission v. XXXX ( 2009 ) the federal district court decided in favor of the Federal Trade Commission that a collection agency must operate within strict guidelines in the collection of a debt. The criteria are as follows : 1 ) The debt must still be enforceable within the state of procurement or where the original obligator resides, or a combination of both. 
2 ) The debt collector must be licensed and bonded if applicable within the state in which it is trying to collect, if the debt is collectable. 
3 ) The validation of debt ownership must be proved, without exception. 
There is no statement on the attached collection that the debt is no longer enforceable. The collection agency stipulates that Bank of America obtained a judgment against me. By legal mandate, the docket number of the judgment must be listed as well as what county clerk 's office the judgment is filed with. In this case, there is no judgment. The statement saying "" This judgment may be forwarded to an attorney for execution '' is a complete falsehood. There can not be a lawsuit as the legal time limit to enforce a summary judgment action has passed. 
Even though the collection letter states that illegal, abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collections are illegal, this collection in its entirety is just that, a deceptive illegal attempt to collect a debt that is no longer enforceable. 
I demand that all my information be purged immediately by XXXX and Bank of America, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take the necessary steps to sanction both companies for using such abusive collection tactics.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'xxxx', 'makes', 'a', 'claim', 'with', 'the', 'consumer', 'financial', 'protection', 'bureau', 'cfpb', 'that', 'the', 'following', 'attached', 'attempt', 'to', 'collect', 'a', 'debt', 'is', 'highly', 'fraudulent', 'my', 'personal', 'information', 'is', 'being', 'floated', 'in', 'what', 'is', 'known', 'in', 'the', 'debt', 'collection', 'business', 'as', 'a', 'debt', 'pool', 'whereas', 'collection', 'information', 'is', 'outdated', 'and', 'not', 'even', 'enforceable', 'the', 'attached', 'collection', 'from', 'xxxx', 'does', 'not', 'state', 'that', 'the', 'debt', 'is', 'no', 'longer', 'enforceable', 'a', 'stipulation', 'by', 'the', 'federal', 'trade', 'commission', 'the', 'method', 'of', 'an', 'illegal', 'posting', 'of', 'a', 'collection', 'on', 'my', 'personal', 'credit', 'report', 'or', 'an', 'illegal', 'collection', 'against', 'my', 'rights', 'of', 'the', 'fair', 'debt', 'collection', 'practices', 'act', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tolerated', 'in', 'federal', 'trade', 'commission', 'v', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and nine', 'the', 'federal', 'district', 'court', 'decided', 'in', 'favor', 'of', 'the', 'federal', 'trade', 'commission', 'that', 'a', 'collection', 'agency', 'must', 'operate', 'within', 'strict', 'guidelines', 'in', 'the', 'collection', 'of', 'a', 'debt', 'the', 'criteria', 'are', 'as', 'follows', 'one', 'the', 'debt', 'must', 'still', 'be', 'enforceable', 'within', 'the', 'state', 'of', 'procurement', 'or', 'where', 'the', 'original', 'obligator', 'resides', 'or', 'a', 'combination', 'of', 'both', 'two', 'the', 'debt', 'collector', 'must', 'be', 'licensed', 'and', 'bonded', 'if', 'applicable', 'within', 'the', 'state', 'in', 'which', 'it', 'is', 'trying', 'to', 'collect', 'if', 'the', 'debt', 'is', 'collectable', 'three', 'the', 'validation', 'of', 'debt', 'ownership', 'must', 'be', 'proved', 'without', 'exception', 'there', 'is', 'no', 'statement', 'on', 'the', 'attached', 'collection', 'that', 'the', 'debt', 'is', 'no', 'longer', 'enforceable', 'the', 'collection', 'agency', 'stipulates', 'that', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'obtained', 'a', 'judgment', 'against', 'me', 'by', 'legal', 'mandate', 'the', 'docket', 'number', 'of', 'the', 'judgment', 'must', 'be', 'listed', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'what', 'county', 'clerk', 's', 'office', 'the', 'judgment', 'is', 'filed', 'with', 'in', 'this', 'case', 'there', 'is', 'no', 'judgment', 'the', 'statement', 'saying', 'this', 'judgment', 'may', 'be', 'forwarded', 'to', 'an', 'attorney', 'for', 'execution', 'is', 'a', 'complete', 'falsehood', 'there', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'a', 'lawsuit', 'as', 'the', 'legal', 'time', 'limit', 'to', 'enforce', 'a', 'summary', 'judgment', 'action', 'has', 'passed', 'even', 'though', 'the', 'collection', 'letter', 'states', 'that', 'illegal', 'abusive', 'deceptive', 'and', 'unfair', 'debt', 'collections', 'are', 'illegal', 'this', 'collection', 'in', 'its', 'entirety', 'is', 'just', 'that', 'a', 'deceptive', 'illegal', 'attempt', 'to', 'collect', 'a', 'debt', 'that', 'is', 'no', 'longer', 'enforceable', 'i', 'demand', 'that', 'all', 'my', 'information', 'be', 'purged', 'immediately', 'by', 'xxxx', 'and', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'that', 'the', 'consumer', 'financial', 'protection', 'bureau', 'cfpb', 'take', 'the', 'necessary', 'steps', 'to', 'sanction', 'both', 'companies', 'for', 'using', 'such', 'abusive', 'collection', 'tactics']"

3,3,11,60,"This company XXXX XXXX XXXX started contacting my friends back in XX/XX/XXXX impersonating court officials saying they needed to know my whereabouts. My friends informed me of this the day they called. They were even harassing them about information and gave out my SS # and date of birth, etc. Asking them if that was their info. This company then called me and left a voicemail saying the same thing to me. I called and asked them to send me correspondence on this matter which they gave me no information on and I never received any paperwork on this. Fast forward to the last 2 weeks. My mother has now gotten a call on this and they were harassing her about this matter and then this week, on XX/XX/XXXX they called and left me a voicemail saying they were the court and would be delivering documents to me. I called them back again the next day on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to someone. He never identified who he was or what company they were. I gave him the reference number I was given from the voicemail and he pulled up the information. He said it was a Bank of America Visa card that I had that was closed by BOA in XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that number XXXX, I did not have a BOA Visa card and to send me written verification on this so I could verify this and keep for my records and my attorney. He then said there was a Bank of America in all XXXX states. I said maybe there is and once again said to abide by the FDCPA and send me written verification or I am going to have my lawyer contact you. He then got all mad and hung up on me. I have had enough of the harassment from this company, if they even are a company. And, if they are, how is it they can potentially ruin people 's lives and reputations with no repercussion?

3,12,33,94,"XXXX/XXXX/XXXX We refinanced our home with a loan from Countrywide, made payments until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when the market crashed. See Exhibit XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Countrywide sent a Notice of Default and Acceleration letter and said specifically, "" If the default is not cured on or before XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the mortgage payments will be accelerated with the full amount remaining accelerated and becoming due and payable in full, and foreclosure proceedings will be initiated at that time. '' Clearly stated, this is not a foreclosure, but foreclosure may happen in the future. See Exhibit XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX came and went with no additional notices or legal actions as stated in the previous notice. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I file for BK See Exhibit XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I waived my right to a discharge for all debt, letter mailed to creditors XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Statue of Limitations begins to run again 30 days after the mailed letter, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX See Exhibit 4. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Bank of America sends another NOD stating "" Bank of America , N.A . intends to initiate foreclosure action on the mortgaged property. '' This another threat of a lawsuit that never came, but never the less another "" Notice '' and reference a future action that that bank intends to take. See Exhibit 5 Bank of America transfers servicing to XXXX, and later to XXXX. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX sends Notice of Default and Acceleration letter, just like in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and other notices over the previous 7+ years. This is another Notice ; a foreclosure has still not commenced and no other legal action has taken place. See Exhibit 6 According to WA State law, the 6-year statute of limitation for lender to collect on the debt was up on : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

XXXX : Statute of Limitations requires a lender to take an actionto enforce within 6 years of the acceleration for written contracts. Law dictionary define an action as : n. a lawsuit in which one party ( or parties ) sues another. I still have not been a party to a lawsuit that would toll the statute. Exhibit 7 XXXX/XXXX/XXXX comes and goes and no lawsuit is filed. The lender has had over 7 years to take action, still no lawsuit filed, and over 6 years of the Statute of Limitations running. Exhibit XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Trustee records Notice of Trustee Sale, with sale date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Again, a NOTICE as in the title of the document. Lender specifically is choosing not to take legal action and file a lawsuit, rather to follow a non judicial process AFTER the debt is barred from collection. Exhibit 9 XXXX/XXXX/XXXX comes and goes, several continuances of sale are issued. Trustee is aware of SOL issues. Phone calls and letters explain to trustee the situation and they do n't have the sale. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( 120 days past sale date ) comes and goes with no sale occurring. WA foreclosure law requires lender to start the foreclosure process again. Still, no tolling has occurred yet. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Trustee records Discontinuance acknowledging that they have to start over but the last day to have the sale was XXXX See Exhibit 10 Trustee also records new NOTS with new sale date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They are starting over with the foreclosure process on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. See Exhibit 11. 

Now, the lender is wrongfully trying to collect a debt that is barred from collection AGAIN! 

Either way, the 6-year SOL has passed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, over 302 days past the 6 year tolling date, and over 8 years past the first late payment. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agrees to continue the sale until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to look into this further. See Exhibit 12. 

As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have still not been sued by the lender, Bank, "" holder '' "" servicer '' or any other party claiming to have standing to do so, nor has anyone commence a Judicial Foreclosure.

They said Bank of America assigned the debt collection to them. The summon looked fishy because it did not have a file case number on it. I called the Superior court in XXXX, XXXX, and the clerks told me I could not file my answer to XXXX , XXXX ' complaint because there was no file case number to file it under. I had only 20 days to sent my Answer to XXXX , XXXX in XXXX. I sent my Answer and request for debt verification, and validation with requests for proof of ownership of debt, chain of assignment, the contract between Bank of America and XXXX , XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX , XXXX received the certified mail on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

I wait for XXXX , XXXX while I checked nearly everyday Superior court record for a file case number for nearly four month. I was very sick and waiting for surgery, so I was focusing on my health. I forgot about XXXX , XXXX I thought they drop the lawsuit because they ignore my request for debt information, and they never sent me anything that I asked for. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX my roommate handled me a letter from XXXX , XXXX. It was confusing letter because it listed dates for a court trial on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ... A year away. This letter had a file case number on it dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. There was no words about them winning a default judgment against me. I found out about the default judgment my calling the Superior court with the file case number, and the clerk told me, yes, XXXX , XXXX got a default judgment on me. I filed my Answer, Motion to Vacate, and evidence, and file a counterclaim under the file case number on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX , XXXX was not suppose to file default judgment without providing supported proof, and complete evidences of ownership of debt collection right, contract between Bank of America, and between me to pay them, ect. 

I want you to go after XXXX , XXXX for violations FDCPA, and XXXX consumer fraud laws. XXXX , XXXX used unfair, misleading statements, ignore my request to show proof of debt, ownership of debt, and right to collect payments, fees on debt, and right to bring sue and get a default judgment without a contract. Contract terms to fees, interest, ect. XXXX , XXXX quickly put the default judgment on public record because another lawyer contact me to offer help with bankruptcy filing. 

I only have a small veteran pension, so that is judgment proof, but the judgment has now hurt my credit ratings again. I told XXXX , XXXX this in my Answer. I want you to charge XXXX , XXXX old debt buyers heavy fines for violations, request them to remove any public and private default judgment on credit bureaus records, forbid XXXX , XXXX from selling my account information to other debt buyers, and have them remove any bad inquiries off all credit bureaus, and encourage them to pay me counterclaim fees for fraud, misrepresentations, wrongful lawsuit, and damaging character image with wrongful default judgment. 

I want you to sue them, collect my violation fees, and remove the default judgment from all public and private credit records since they got it through fraud.

5,14,14,17,"I attended XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was unable to afford the school tuition on my own so I had to take out student loans. When filling out the applications at the school I was ensured that all of my loans would be federal student loans with low interest rates. I never had a choice in who I was taking the loans out with or what the terms were. I was just given the application to fill out. I had no knowledge that I was taking out private loans for my tuition until after I stopped attending school and they became due. During my program at XXXX I was having financial difficulties due to trying to work full time and go to school full time. I spoke with the head of the criminal justice department about the possibility of having to drop out of school to get a part time job. He directed me to speak with XXXX of the financial counselors and was very adamant that quitting the program would be a huge mistake and school should come before anything else in my life. When I spoke with the financial counselor she told me that I could take out extra federal loans for living expenses while I was in school. She said these loans were made just for people like me who needed some extra help while in school and struggling financially. She said they would be just like the federal loans I had initiated for my tuition but were just with different banks. She gave me a list of websites to use and gave me all of the school documents that I would need to apply for these loans. I was assisted in applying for these loans at the school. I was made to feel like I had no choice. I was essentially bullied into these loans that I am now stuck with. During the course of my time at XXXX I took out XXXX private student loans for living expenses that I thought to be federal loans with low interest rates. Also, I have XXXX private loan that was used towards my tuition at XXXX. All of these loans were explained to me as being federal loans with low interest rates that I could get payment assistance on if ever needed after I was out of school. I was pushed into these loans when I discussed my financial difficulties and my desire to end my attendance at the school with the faculty there. I was forced into bankruptcy in XXXX because of these student loans and have been paying them diligently every month. I have a very good job and make a decent wage but am unable to move forward with my adult life because of these loans. I can not buy a home because my DTI is too high even though I now have outstanding credit. Had I been told the truth about these loans and the implications of getting them, I would have never done so. I was lied to about the type of loans I was getting and the interest rates I would get. Also, there is no way when I took out these private loans that I showed with my pay at the time that I could afford to pay these back. I feel as though there were predators on both the lending side and the education side. Thousands of dollars were so easily accessible to someone young who is just trying to get an education and believing in what they are being told by the school they are attending. They clearly had no qualms about getting me into over $ XXXX in debt at a very young age because they were retaining a student who would continue to get loans to pay the tuition. All they cared about was getting my money. These loans have essentially ruined my financial life. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and am unable to buy a home or start a family because I still have many years to pay back these loans. I am currently trying to refinance these loans to have a lower payment which has been very tough and stressful. I was taken advantage of by this school and these lenders just to try to better my life with an education.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'attended', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'from', 'xxxx',

There are issues where the consumer has been condemned and denied remedy and now offers this complaint for their refusal to independently conduct or outsource an investigation into all activities associated with the mortgage account, despite the consumer 's request to review ALL documents ( proof of claims ) subject to public access and to certify all parties activities in regard to the named trust.

XXXX assignment does not transfer a mortgage under XXXX law. The secured lender is the person who holds the promissory note the mortgage secures.

The XXXX assignment is ineffective because XXXX never owned the note. XXXX assignment is ineffective to transfer ownership of a mortgage. Ownership of a mortgage is in issue, the person claiming to own the mortgage must produce an assignment from the original lender or the original promissory note, and that it 's properly endorsed. 

After the Assignment of Mortgage and Sheriff Sale occurred, the "" debt collector '', had ABSOLUTELY no authority, interest, either legal or beneficial in the assignment, sheriff sale or the named trust, but yet commenced to defend the foreclosure of property in federal court when all related documents executed involved the element of forgery [ robo-signing ] which was used in collusion with the banks as an attempt assign [ transfer ] and sale/auction property to the "" HOLDERS '' of the named trust to effectuate the foreclosure, but in reality no actual sale/auction or foreclosure can take place under a void assignment.

3,3,33,6,"I was sent an unsolicited credit card from Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly after, I was laid off from my job due to the economy and was unable to find a job for over a year so I used the card for gas & food during that time. I soon fell behind in the payments and most of the card debt was late payments and penalties. Unfortunately I had moved and I forgot about it when I started working again. XXXX XXXX bought the debt years later and sued me. I tried to explain my circumstances, that I was in school and did not make very much money and that I owned nothing. I 'm still driving the XXXX Impala that mother bought me when I was in high school. They refused to listen and threatened & intimidated me into signing an agreement to pay {$75.00} a month which I knew I could n't afford, but I had never had any dealings with the law so I was scared and thought I had to sign it. When I could n't pay it, they sued me. I know I have to pay it and I have been sending them {$25.00} a month but I lost my lease and had to move so I was unemployed again XX/XX/XXXX. I worked odd, temporary jobs during that time and finally found another full time job XX/XX/XXXX but I only make {$11.00} an hour and have been struggling to survive and catch up on my rent since then,. But I started paying the {$25.00} a month again then. But XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX froze my bank account and took my last {$190.00} out which meant I had no money for food and gas for over a week. When I read up on Florida Garnishment Rules, I saw that they are not supposed to be able to garnish a person 's salary if they make below a certain level and that includes their bank account if it can be proved that the money was income. The only money going into my bank account was my salary. I have tried to talk to them several times and even had my mother call them because I 'm not very informed about these matters, but they only say they are trying to collect a debt for their customer and wo n't agree to a lessor payment. It is not for a lot of money, only about {$2500.00} but I do n't have it and neither does my mother. She lost our house to Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX and we have both been trying to recover since then. We ca n't even afford a lawyer to fight them and feel like we are victims of the law and have no recourse against this unscrupulous company. We will pay the debt but we need time. I have told them that as soon as I can pay more I will increase the amount. But I need enough money for rent, food and gas so i can work and i do n't make much more than that. I would like to pay it in full now but there is no way i can do so.

3,3,10,92,"Upon application for mortgage, XXXX XXXX informed me of a bad debt on my credit report from Bank Of America ( BoA ). I have no accounts with BoA. I called BoA who stated I had a past due balance of {$360.00} on a credit card account. I told BoA I did not have a credit card with them and asked for more details. The BoA customer service rep stated that my current statement showed a past due balance of {$360.00}. I reiterated that I do not have a credit card with BoA. I then asked when the account was opened, when the charges were made, and by whom. The rep stated that he did not have access to that information and transferred me to another department, at which time I was disconnected from the system. I called back. Different rep. Went through the whole story again. Rep tried to transfer me to a different department. I declined and requested documentation/verification of the debt be sent to me in writing. I provided my current address. Rep said would send verification and I should receive it in 7-10 days. Never received it. Called back a few weeks later, same drill, same promise to send documentation through the mail. I still have not received it. Called again yesterday. Yesterday the rep "" XXXX '' informed me that he had to transfer me to the Fraud division because the name on the account in question does not match my social security number. Transferred to me to "" XXXX '' in the Fraud division. "" XXXX '' asked me many demographic questions to verify my identity then told me privacy rules prohibited her from giving me information about the account since it was not in my name. I then asked XXXX to remove the information from all XXXX credit bureaus until BoA sorted out their issues. XXXX denied my request as she claimed not to have the authority to update the credit bureaus. She stated the fraud investigation would take approx 30 days. I told her this was unacceptable as I was in the mortgage underwriting process and BoA needed to take care of the situation. I again requested verification/documentation of the debt on my credit report as I had nothing in writing from BoA as of this date. Citing privacy concerns again, "" XXXX '' transferred me to another department, where I was promptly disconnected. Called back. Got "" XXXX ''. Explained the situation to XXXX. XXXX unable to help. Transferred me to "" XXXX ''. Explained the situation to XXXX. XXXX explained she was unable to help. Requested XXXX send me documentation of the account, the charges, and status of account. XXXX only had access to XXXX and XXXX statements and agreed to send them to me even though they did not contain data about when acct was opened, what the charges were, or when the charges were incurred. I asked her to transfer me to someone who could provide that information. XXXX transferred me to another dept where I was promptly disconnected ( again ). 

I have made numerous attempts to obtain verification of this debt with BoA and they simply can not /will not comply. I can not file disputes with the credit bureaus at this juncture because I can not close my mortgage loan with open disputes on my credit report. I 've been getting the runaround since XXXX and I 'm hoping you can encourage BoA to provide the debt verification/documentation to which I am legally entitled.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL

5,14,9,108,"On XXXX XXXX 2016, I received a statement from XXXX whom is servicing my student loan from Bank of America, the statement stated that total balance was {$360.00}. Past Due of {$280.00} current due of {$80.00}. Balance of the loan {$12000.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 they received a payment from me for {$120.00}, I then wrote a check to make the full payment due of {$360.00} prior to the XXXX XXXX 2016 due date. On XXXX XXXX 2016, the money had not been removed from my account. I then contacted XXXX the XX/XX/2016. They stated to me the loan had defaulted, to call XXXX, when I called this number it was a collection agency XXXX stating they are working for Bank of America. I contact XXXX back and explained my situation explained that I had even offered to make the full past due amount on the day XXXX contact them XXXX XXXX or XXXX, because the XXXX was a Saturday. Explained I had made a payment on XXXX/XXXX/16 less then 30 days prior to receiving the statement for the {$360.00}. Requested that XXXX-Bank of America allow me to make the full past due payment and stop the defaulting of the loan. I was even willing to set up 3 months of auto payments for the regular payment amount of {$80.00}, in addition to bringing the account current. XXXX on behalf of Bank of America, made no phone calls to me in XXXX to notify me that the account was this close to default or to request an immediate payment which I would have worked with them to make specially since I was already attempting to make the full past due payment. There was no mail sent to me between XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX to notify me that default was about to happen, nor did the statement sent to me on XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX again on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and XXXX/XXXX/2016, and request that they contact Bank of America, and allow me to make the past due payment that I attempted to do by sending a check they never recieved prior to the XXXX, I also requested XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that they allow me to make an automatic payment to them over the phone as I spoke to them for the full past due to pull the account and stop the defaulting. When I spoke to them on the XXXX or XXXX of XXXX the Rep proceeded to say the defaulting had been filed but never stated that it had been completed. As well as the Rep from XXXX on the first phone call stated they would have to call me back because the account had n't fully transferred. Which leads me to believe that if the Rep from XXXX-Bank of America would have accepted the payment for the full past due over the phone my account could have been removed from the default, I would be able to resume month payments. On XXXX/XXXX/16 the Rep from XXXX further confirmed my believe by stating that although they had n't received the check that I know believe was lost in the mail, that if there was a payment on file for the full past due they ( XXXX ) could have communicated that with Bank of America. After speaking with the Rep at XXXX they are stating that the only payment option I have is {$360.00} amount for 36 months or settle for 60-80 % of balance up front. There is absolutely no way that I can afford that amount. I am a single mother with absolutely no assistance or financial support for my child but myself. I have requested both XXXX provide me with a number for BANK of AMERICA directly so that I can work this out and make a payment for the full past due amount to them and continue regular month installments. XXXX says they only have a number to XXXX. Lastly, I had a co-signer on the loan ( XXXX/Bank of America ) made no attempt to contact the cosigner, which I believe violates the point of a co-signer, they would have contacted me to make sure we took care of this immediately. Yet XXXX stated they would be contacting the cosigner. I believe XXXX/B of A, violated the Co-signers right as well because they never notified them before default so a resolution could be set.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxx',

3,12,33,94,"This Affidavit and Notice of Complaint is being filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for a more transparent investigation.

XXXX and the lender/creditor AMERICA 'S WHOLESALE LENDER ( no longer in business ) are the only recorded lien holders of the mortgaged property and promissory note and without full disclosure of the purpose and intent, the consumer by virtue of his right to ownership and legal title in property in the mortgage, was used as an accommodating party in this mortgage contract, to mortgage ; warrant ; grant and convey to XXXX '' ( solely as nominee for Lender AMERICA 'S WHOLESALE LENDER ), said property and said conveyance caused a separation in the mortgage files [ note and mortgage ]. 

The "" debt collector '', has taken unfair advantage of the misinformed consumer by acting as Vice President of XXXX in collusion with financial entities after a default occurred, to use the private database called XXXX to circumvent a securitization procedure ( establishing priority of liens ) and the property 's legal owner [ valid recorded lien holder ], avoiding the expense of promptly recording the transfer [ assignment ], thus leaving concealed behind XXXX the [ securitization ] and the time frame in which a property transfer [ assignment ] should be made to a trust and recorded. Pursuant to Landmark v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX 2009 ) ( in this case the XXXX Court provides the most cogent state court analysis of the problem created by securitization - the "" splitting '' of the note and the mortgage and the real party in interest and standing problems that the holder of the mortgage has when it can not also show that it has clean and clear legal interest in the note ). 

XXXX assignment does not transfer a mortgage under New York law. The secured lender is the person who holds the promissory note the mortgage secures. For the bank, alleged lender, to prove it was the noteholder, the bank, alleged lender, need to supply proof of a written assignment of the note or to produce the original note, endorsed over to the bank, alleged lender of public record. The XXXX assignment is ineffective because XXXX never owned the note. XXXX assignment is ineffective to transfer ownership of a mortgage. Ownership of a mortgage is in issue, the person claiming to own the mortgage must produce an assignment from the original lender or the original promissory note, and that it 's properly endorsed. 

After a default of the mortgage occurred the "" debt collector '', acted as Vice President of XXXX and executed a mortgage transfer on behalf of XXXX XXXX as trustee, that involves the element of an

3,3,33,96,"I was the victim of an Illegal Debt Collection Lawsuit Mill owned and operated by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Georgia-based law firm. From what I can tell, apparently XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX take care of all the legal proceedings for XXXX XXXX, a company that purchased my credit card debt from XXXX, in the amount of {$3500.00}. 

Back in XXXX, I went through a financial hardship, and was having difficulties maintaining my mortgage payment and keeping up with credit card debt. I had no choice but to walk away from our home and all debt. As a consequence for my financial irresponsibility, my credit score dropped all the way down to XXXX and stayed there for over 7 years, making it very hard for my wife and I to purchase things like automobiles, a new home, or get any type of new credit. 

At the XXXX, nearly 7 years later, most of that bad debt started to drop off of my credit report as a result of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) rules and regulations. Through secure credit cards and other means my credit score started to improve ( XXXX ). 

Then in XXXX XXXX, while logging into my credit monitoring account ( XXXX ), I noticed that my credit score had dropped significantly. It was the result of a new default judgement showing up as a public record. Here are the details of this judgement : Date Filed : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Reference # : XXXX Court : XXXX CO Magistrate Plaintiff : XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount : {$3400.00} I was never given notice of this lawsuit, nor was I ever served. I believe this debt had already exceeded the statute of limitations from the date of last activity ( DLA ). Yet, it is not haunting me, and preventing me from purchasing a new home many years later. 

I also found this article published on your site related to the the unethical business practices used by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in attempt to make financial gains, through the use of questionable default judgements, at the expense of their victims.

3,3,7,39,"XX/XX/XXXXCredit Report Confirmation # XXXX dispute is with the negative entry by Bank of America XXXX BOA XXXX. 

When making the telephone call to cancel ( close out ) my BOA credit card I told the woman I talked with that I wanted to sever all contact with BOA. She replied in the affermative that it would be done. Then said that in the event that a charge should appear I want it disregarded and no charge for insufficient funds as my account was closed. She had to talk with her supervisor about this. After this consultation she told me that it was okay. No further activity on my account would occur. I am absolutely positive about this conversation. Am not so sure about the following. 

Sometime thereafter I received a charge from BOA. Believe the charge was for insufficient funds. Believe that I called BOA and told them of the arrangement concerning my account closing. I may have received an additional bill by mail but did not receive any more invoices. 

I assumed that everything had been settled with BOA until I was turned down for a credit card with XXXX XXXX Bank. Got a credit report and found the negative entry from BOA. Before cancelling my BOA credit card I had previously cancelled ( closed XXXX my bank account. This account was closed because they made errors, one very significant. The branch manager could not believe how badly they had messed up! Now they made another error and they are making me pay ( with a bad credit file ) for another oftheir mistakes! 

How long are recordings of conversations with banks kept? My credit file indicates that the problem probably started in XX/XX/XXXX. So my initial tel conversation with BOA probably occurred a max of XXXX months prior. So the voracity of what I said should not be too difficult to confirm. 

Many thanks for your investigation of this matter. I have long been a fan of the CFPB since XXXX XXXX initiated it. XXXX further impressed with XXXX XXXX.

3,12,33,94,"XX/XX/XXXX We refinanced our home with a loan from Countrywide, made payments until XX/XX/XXXX when the market crashed. See Exhibit 1 XX/XX/XXXX Countrywide sent a Notice of Default and Acceleration letter and said specifically, "" If the default is not cured on or before XX/XX/XXXX, the mortgage payments will be accelerated with the full amount remaining accelerated and becoming due and payable in full, and foreclosure proceedings will be initiated at that time. '' Clearly stated, this is not a foreclosure, but foreclosure may happen in the future. See Exhibit 2 XX/XX/XXXX came and went with no additional notices or legal actions as stated in the previous notice. 

XXXX I file for BK See Exhibit 3 XX/XX/XXXX I waived my right to a discharge for all debt, letter mailed to creditors XX/XX/XXXX. Statue of Limitations begins to run again 30 days after the mailed letter, XX/XX/XXXX See Exhibit 4. 

XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America sends another NOD stating "" Bank of America , N.A . intends to initiate foreclosure action on the mortgaged property. '' This another threat of a lawsuit that never came, but never the less another "" Notice '' and reference a future action that that bank intends to take. See Exhibit 5 Bank of America transfers servicing to XXXX, and later to XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX sends Notice of Default and Acceleration letter, just like in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and other notices over the previous 7+ years. This is another Notice ; a foreclosure has still not commenced and no other legal action has taken place. See Exhibit 6 According to WA State law, the 6-year statute of limitation for lender to collect on the debt was up on : XX/XX/XXXX. 

RCW 62A.3-118 : Statute of Limitations requires a lender to take an actionto enforce within 6 years of the acceleration for written contracts. Law dictionary define an action as : n. a lawsuit in which one party ( or parties ) sues another. I still have not been a party to a lawsuit that would toll the statute. Exhibit 7 XX/XX/XXXX comes and goes and no lawsuit is filed. The lender has had over 7 years to take action, still no lawsuit filed, and over 6 years of the Statute of Limitations running. Exhibit XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Trustee records Notice of Trustee Sale, with sale date XX/XX/XXXX. Again, a NOTICE as in the title of the document. Lender specifically is choosing not to take legal action and file a lawsuit, rather to follow a non judicial process AFTER the debt is barred from collection. Exhibit 9 XX/XX/XXXX comes and goes, several continuances of sale are issued. Trustee is aware of SOL issues. Phone calls and letters explain to trustee the situation and they do n't have the sale. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( 120 days past sale date ) comes and goes with no sale occurring. WA foreclosure law requires lender to start the foreclosure process again. Still, no tolling has occurred yet. 

XX/XX/XXXX Trustee records Discontinuance acknowledging that they have to start over but the last day to have the sale was XX/XX/XXXX.. See Exhibit 10 Trustee also records new NOTS with new sale date of XX/XX/XXXX. They are starting over with the foreclosure process on XX/XX/XXXX. See Exhibit 11. 

Now, the lender is wrongfully trying to collect a debt that is barred from collection AGAIN! 

Either way, the 6-year SOL has passed on XX/XX/XXXX, over 302 days past the 6 year tolling date, and over 8 years past the first late payment. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agrees to continue the sale until XX/XX/XXXX to look into this further. See Exhibit 12. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have still not been sued by the lender, Bank, "" holder '' "" servicer '' or any other party claiming to have standing to do so, nor has anyone commence a Judicial Foreclosure.

XXXX continued to send me statements on a nonexistent mortgage. Both companies applied homeowners insurance to the property and told me I was responsible for that debt, too. Bank of America went so far as to put retroactive homeowners insurance debt on the property, dating back to at least a year before I stopped paying the insurance myself ; also dated before the bankruptcy by 4 months. They applied an {$11000.00} lien onto the mortgage, as well. I contacted the Comptroller of the Currency with my complaint with complete detail and, after many months was told that I still needed to pay Bank of America, regardless of the bankruptcy. This week I received a letter from something called XXXX XXXX XXXX, which claims to be working for XXXX.

We understand that the mortgage instrument is a statement that real property is collateral for the faithful performance under the note. If the maker of the note fails to perform then the collateral can be sold to satisfy the balance due on the note. But without a valid note that memorializes the terms of the debt, the mortgage is collateral for an obligation that does not exist -- - unless the note is improperly sold to an innocent third party who pays value, in good faith without knowledge of the maker 's defenses. That bona fide third party is protected under the law. 
If the maker executes an instrument that is defective in some way by reference to parole evidence ( outside the assertions made on the note ) then the third party can enforce the note against the maker despite the existence of otherwise valid defenses of the maker of the note. For anyone other than an innocent holder in due course, the burden is on them to prove that the note was merged with the debt. 
So the questions that we need to be answered are these since the issues have not been addressed for those who have pursued foreclosure have used legal presumptions in a twisted way -- - arriving at the conclusion that a debtor need not know the identity of the actual creditor in order for the obligation to be enforced.Our title concerns are that according to the documents provided by Bank of America N.A, is being researched almost monthly so questiondid you hear or see any evidence that identified the party to whom the payments from the borrower were forwarded? 
If not, why did you assume that such a party existed and had authorized the parties in court to act on collateral for the benefit of the real creditor? 
did you hear or see any evidence that connects the real creditors with the parties who appeared in court? 
If not, why did you assume that such a connection existed with an unidentified entity?

A huge portion of this debt was encurred as a result of late fees garnered during this period while I was under the impression that my account was frozen. The late fees were then combined with over the limit fees. Additional fees were then added on when the debts were sold from agency to angency all of which sent the XXXX ( XXXX? ) dollar original credit limit to XXXX!

3,12,11,5,"I purchase my home in XXXX through XXXX and financed by Bank of America. At the time of purchase my home was valued {$180000.00} and the home was purchased for {$150000.00} I was then offered a equity line of credit through Bank of America for {$35000.00} for Home Improvement. Shortly after Home Improvement the home was reappraised by the bank and was value of {$210000.00} 6 months after home improvements the bank send me a letter requesting that I pay back the equity line of {$35000.00} infull payment, because my home is no longer of value and it 's only worth {$75000.00} I immediately contacted the bank and started Communications trying to restructure my mortgage being in shock not knowing what was happening to the real estate market. 

The bank in communication told me that they can not do anything to help me or restructure my mortgage payments because I have not missed a payment and they do n't care what my home is worth they just want their money back. I was then informed by a Bank of America customer service representative that the only way they can help me is for me to miss at least three payments so I stopped paying my mortgage in XXXX and by XXXX second XXXX the bank started filing for foreclosure. 

Shortly after that the Department of Justice ordered that the equity line of credit is to be charged off and I did not have to pay it back. Bank of America mediately report the & gt ; charged off as derogatory & lt ; to the credit bureau and sold the main mortgage to XXXX lending. Bank of America also reported a & gt ; foreclosure initiation & lt ; to the credit bureau. 

I sold the above mentioned home in XXXX on a short sale and XXXX receive the {$35000.00} of what the home was valued after depreciation at the time and was sold for. XXXX then reported the sale of the home and final payment & gt ; in full pay less than {$150000.00} what is owed & lt ; on my credit, and a report of. & gt ; balance charged off & lt ; it was send to the IRS, reported as income. The IRS charged off as a loss of mortgage. 


In less than one years after purchasing my home the depreciation started and had dropped in price from {$210000.00} to {$35000.00}. 

My credit is now ruined with no fault of my own and the banks were bailed out by the government and the consumer is left holding bad debt. This is not right! Someone need to do something. 

I am now unable to attain a normal interest rate and also unable to purchase another home because of these derogatory statements on the credit report showing either foreclosure, tax lien, legal action taken, or repossession.

The address in which they have on their credit application is an address in which I have not lived in over twenty years.

We had never received a XXXX from B of A. 
I did our finances for the 20 years we were married. I had had a B of A credit card years ago, but he never had anything B of A. The IRS said I have to clear it up with B of A. 
My 1st call was with a rep that was no help what so ever. On my next call I got a very nice young man that scoured all B of A computer systems with my husbands social security number and could not find him anywhere. They did find that old credit card of mine. He gave me the XXXX Research and Dispute Dept. 's fax number and had me send the IRS letter and request a copy of the XXXX we had never received. I waited about 5 days to make sure the fax had been distributed to someone and was n't just sitting in a basket somewhere and followed the fax with a call to that Dept. They also could find no record of any trace of my husband let alone the XXXX sent to the IRS and not us. A very nice Manager there took over and called a couple of times to say no luck. Finally I received a copy of the XXXX in the mail. It has the Debt description as "" Direct Auto ''. The address for my husband is over 20 years old. We were married 20 years and he had left that city probably 3 years before that. And he had a car financed by a private party nearly paid off when I met him. It was not Direct Auto. He had bad credit when I met him and I believe there was a bankruptcy, but from XX/XX/XXXX I can swear he never had an auto or any kind of loan with Direct Auto or Bank of America. And it never appeared on any credit bureau over the 20 years we were together. I worked in the consumer finance industry for 10 years and I am well versed in all of it. I regularly pulled credit bureaus on us both. 
With the copy of the XXXX I called back. No one in the XXXX Dispute Dept could find anything again in any data base. Someone must have found something to send me that copy of the XXXX. 
Finally a competent supervisor of the Regulatory Complaint XXXX. in B of A. took ownership of the [ problem, got me a correct XXXX showing {$0.00} cancellation of debt. They submitted it to the IRS and I finally got a letter from the IRS stating I did not owe them anything. 
Today I received a new XXXX from Bank of America for the same {$4100.00} this time the debt was cancelled XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have submitted this as a complaint of impersonating a govt. official because when I call the number on the XXXX the recording says I reached the Home Retention Dept and they are a debt collection agency. I believe they are using the XXXX as a fraudulent attempt to collect a debt. And in this case XXXX that was previously found to have no merit.

3,15,7,39,"About 3 years ago, I started my own XXXX and opened up a BOA business account along with a credit card merchant service. When I signed up the contract with the bank agent, the guy told me that I can cancel the credit card merchant service any time I want without any penalty. Things have been going smoothly until I closed my business 6 month ago, when the BOA collection department started sending me letter and had me pay them {$540.00}. I understand that I am responsible for the {$44.00} as it is the service fee for the last six months, but I have no idea why they ask me to pay the {$500.00}. After getting the first letter from them, my son called them immediately in an attempt to figure out where the {$500.00} came from. The representative said that the {$500.00} is something called "" Early Termination Fee '' which I should take care of it as my XXXX shut down before the contract is over. I was extremely frustrated because the bank agent did not mention anything about the "" Early Termination Fee '' in the beginning, she kept telling that I was able to cancel the service freely. My son had negotiated with the collection department and customer service for a long time, and finally they agreed to escalated my case to their management level to see whether they can waive the {$500.00}. Two weeks later, my son got a phone call from a lady whose name is XXXX XXXX I believe ( her phone number is XXXX ), she told us that we no longer need to pay the {$500.00}. I was glad that they waived the {$500.00} at the end, but when I called back the collection department to double check, they still told me I own them {$500.00}. Then my son tried to get in touch with XXXX XXXX, Customer Service, and Collection department to figure out what 's going on here. Customer Service and XXXX XXXX said I do not own them {$500.00}, but the collection department kept sending me letter for the {$500.00}. I am really lost now. It takes long time to get through their phone tree and waiting time, so I decide to lodge a complain here and ask for help.

Not in the entirety of that timeframe was I ever responded to about the debt in question. I was never shown XXXX iota of validity to lead to any collection action and not a lien placed on property that had previously been in this persons mothers name and briefly in hers XXXX. I become the legal owner via handwriting and notarized letter in XXXX and by recorded deed XXXX. The property has been attached and this is XXXX issue showing proof it was attachable? The home is payment for a debt in medical fees taken from my own personal injury monies for this person in XXXX after her mom, and brother passed with in a year of each other she became sick and was hospitalized for 8weeks and unable to return to a home alone. We paid for her needs and nurses as her income since XXXX had not been more than {$460.00} if that & all her debts were behind due to the recent deaths of those who aided her living. 

Another is proof of the original debt balance minus fees added in due to ignoring all attempts to make arrangements. 

Currently I chose to sell the house to get my money quickly and pay overdue taxes. I learned of the lien in XXXX. I have been nonstop trying to settle the XXXX debts involved. XXXX contacted fairly fast and instructed me they also held the other collection matter but the bank did n't wish to allow them to open it. I was told to call the bank directly. I had already done that and left many messages but agreed. 
I called and someone picked up, I was asked verifiers and given little information back. The debt was showing $ XXXX, fees and all. The female stated she was shocked to see I had called over a month ago and not had a return call. I am too. I made an offer based on the fees not being in the debt- {$3600.00} and gave the fax to the buyers law firm to send the acceptance and wiring info to. Made it clear how dire the mess was over this hold up and the debt not being mine I could really use this at a fast pace. 
She made notes and said it sounded fair and if she could she would ok it but ca n't. I should hear back in few days maximum. A week and half has passed and not XXXX word. 
I have called and left messages nothing back. I recently faxed a rescinded offer along with the new terms. If silence remains the only answer I am forced to file violations of FDCPA and other consumers complaints. The whole debt is a joke without proof and to cost me and mine our lives saving and home over another person debt is just cruel. 
I am selling the home so they have no true reason to hold this up except interest greed. My new offer is {$2900.00} and I am currently looking for local ways out of my having to pay them at all. I have been served collections for a debt and lost earnest on a house we wanted to purchase over this. Not even XXXX response. 
I forwarded the updates and requested the collection agency that I had spoke to before also contact them. 
So far to date ... I have a buyer, a house, XXXX debt that is ready to settle but no way to move thanks to a bank that has not proved this debt and as of today it has been over a month since I asked for proof this year. Over 4 years and lost count of the days since the first time. Please help me. I have to close this like a blink of an eye. Or I will have my own collections and my new address will be corner of XXXX and XXXX cardboard box fridgadaire. Sounds funny but serious as it can be. 
My health is n't good and I ca n't work I can not handle this stress. I have been sick for weeks on end dealing with this.

3,12,33,94,"TILA Rescission letter was mailed on XXXX XXXX, 2010. The effect of TILA Rescission is, as a matter of law and by operation of law, to cancel the loan contract, and to render the note and mortgage void. The matter is well settled, to wit : the rescission exists, it is effective as a matter of law. The rescission is effective upon mailing. The pretender lender, Bank of America N. A., do not dispute that rescission has occurred but seek to invoke issues in a case that is not and can not be before any Court, to wit : whether the rescission is effective. And they seek to do so through motions in which they deftly avoid the requirement of pleading and proving facts in a proper lawsuit to vacate the rescission, thus depriving the homeowner of their right to raise appropriate defenses to the non-existent lawsuit seeking to foreclose. Pretender lender want the courts to enter an order that would impliedly vacate the rescission. The pretender lender seek to have the court assume facts about the consummation of the alleged loan including the date or dates when consummation occurred and the source of funding for the alleged loan. They even want the court to assume that disclosures were adequate. They seek to have courts adopt the premise that the rescission is not effective upon mailing if there are potentially defects in the reasoning or actions of the borrower. ( XXXX v Countrywide ). SCOTUS clearly stated that the rescission is complete upon mailing, regardless of whether it is disputed or not. This eliminate the right of Bank of America N. A., et al to raise a challenge. All three branches of government are in unanimous agreement : TILA Rescission is effective upon mailing by operation of law.

3,12,11,5,"We are filing a dispute regarding the failure for Bank of America ( BAC ) to complete a modification review under Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ). 
Our loan was originated in XXXX with XXXX Mortgage Company, which in deed makes our family eligible for the review of HAMP programs and all of the programs original intent and initiatives for benefit of homeowner such as myself. It is unlawful on multiple levels for our loan to be discriminated and excluded from review of such programs based on XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) being named as investor/owner for our mortgage loan. Although we are thankful for consideration and approval of a modification program, we are dishearten by the fact that BAC, and XXXX are purposely overlooking our family for a much more beneficial program than what has been offered on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
The reasons given for our multiple denials of HAMP not only are ambiguous, but also evasive and without detail or relevant cause and appear to be a ploy to avoid offering our family a deeper savings at 31 % of our gross income. My theory, is that both BAC and OLS presumed the HAMP program to be dissolved at the end of XXXX, and the denials were a preemptive decision made prior to the FHFA 's announcement made that HAMP was being extended until the end of XXXX. 

Both BAC and XXXX, are major participants of the HAMP program and it is completely out of character of industry standards since XXXX and in the wake of both financial institutes losing federal lawsuits for thousands of acts of deception, abuse and fraud of homeowners nationwide. In fact there are still thousands of pending and unresolved lawsuits against of XXXX. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) engaged in a deceptive scheme to delay or deny permanent mortgage loan modifications through the federal Home Affordable Modification Program ( "" HAMP '' ) to desperate homeowners, systematically breaching their contractual obligations to homeowners, committing deceptive trade practices, and causing significant financial harm. 

Our loan was approved of what 's called a Bank of America loan modification, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a payment in the amount of {$1200.00}. Based on my gross qualifying monthly income of {$3500.00}, the payment equates to a front end debt to income ( DTI ) ratio of 36 % to 40 %. However, had our loan been reviewed accordingly for the HAMP program, our payments would be based upon 31 % DTI, equating to a much more affordable amount of {$1000.00}. 

We are seeking for our loan to be reconsidered for the HAMP program. We are seeking a more thorough and detailed explanation as to why we are being overlooked for a program that we rightfully should be considered and qualified to receive. This complaint will be forwarded to the our state attorney general as well as Michigan Department of Financial Institution for their review of my grievances.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['we', 'are', 'filing', 'a', 'dispute', 'regarding', 'the', 'failure', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'bac', 'to', 'complete', 'a', 'modification', 'review', 'under', 'home', 'affordable', 'modification', 'program', 'hamp', 'our', 'loan', 'was', 'originated', 'in', 'xxxx', 'with', 'xxxx', 'mortgage', 'company', 'which', 'in', 'deed', 'makes', 'our', 'family', 'eligible', 'for', 'the', 'review', 'of', 'hamp', 'programs', 'and', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'programs', 'original', 'intent', 'and', 'initiatives', 'for', 'benefit', 'of', 'homeowner', 'such', 'as', 'myself', 'it', 'is', 'unlawful', 'on', 'multiple', 'levels', 'for', 'our', 'loan', 'to', 'be', 'discriminated', 'and', 'excluded', 'from', 'review', 'of', 'such', 'programs', 'based', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'being', 'named', 'as', 'investorowner', 'for', 'our', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'although', 'we', 'are', 'thankful', 'for', 'consideration', 'and', 'approval', 'of', 'a', 'modification', 'program', 'we', 'are', 'dishearten', 'by', 'the', 'fact', 'that', 'bac', 'and', 'xxxx', 'are', 'purposely', 'overlooking', 'our', 'family', 'for', 'a', 'much', 'more', 'beneficial', 'program', 'than', 'what', 'has', 'been', 'offered', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'the', 'reasons', 'given', 'for', 'our', 'multiple', 'denials', 'of', 'hamp', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'ambiguous', 'but', 'also', 'evasive', 'and', 'without', 'detail', 'or', 'relevant', 'cause', 'and', 'appear', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'ploy', 'to', 'avoid', 'offering', 'our', 'family', 'a', 'deeper', 'savings', 'at', 'thirty-one', 'of', 'our', 'gross', 'income', 'my', 'theory', 'is', 'that', 'both', 'bac', 'and', 'ols', 'presumed', 'the', 'hamp', 'program', 'to', 'be', 'dissolved', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'xxxx', 'and', 'the', 'denials', 'were', 'a', 'preemptive', 'decision', 'made', 'prior', 'to', 'the', 'fhfa', 's', 'announcement', 'made', 'that', 'hamp', 'was', 'being', 'extended', 'until', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'xxxx', 'both', 'bac', 'and', 'xxxx', 'are', 'major', 'participants', 'of', 'the', 'hamp', 'program', 'and', 'it', 'is', 'completely', 'out', 'of', 'character', 'of', 'industry', 'standards', 'since', 'xxxx', 'and', 'in', 'the', 'wake', 'of', 'both', 'financial', 'institutes', 'losing', 'federal', 'lawsuits', 'for', 'thousands', 'of', 'acts', 'of', 'deception', 'abuse', 'and', 'fraud', 'of', 'homeowners', 'nationwide', 'in', 'fact', 'there', 'are', 'still', 'thousands', 'of', 'pending', 'and', 'unresolved', 'lawsuits', 'against', 'of', 'xxxx', 'the', 'lawsuits', 'allege', 'among', 'other', 'things', 'that', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'engaged', 'in', 'a', 'deceptive', 'scheme', 'to', 'delay', 'or', 'deny', 'permanent', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'modifications', 'through', 'the', 'federal', 'home', 'affordable', 'modification', 'program', 'hamp', 'to', 'desperate', 'homeowners', 'systematically', 'breaching', 'their', 'contractual', 'obligations', 'to', 'homeowners', 'committing', 'deceptive', 'trade', 'practices', 'and', 'causing', 'significant', 'financial', 'harm', 'our', 'loan', 'was', 'approved', 'of', 'what', 's', 'called', 'a', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'loan', 'modification', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'for', 'a', 'payment', 'in', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'one hundred and twenty thousand', 'based', 'on', 'my', 'gross', 'qualifying', 'monthly', 'income', 'of', 'three hundred and fifty thousand', 'the', 'payment', 'equates', 'to', 'a', 'front', 'end', 'debt', 'to', 'income', 'dti', 'ratio', 'of', 'thirty-six', 'to', 'forty', 'however', 'had', 'our', 'loan', 'been', 'reviewed', 'accordingly', 'for', 'the', 'hamp', 'program', 'our', 'payments', 'would', 'be', 'based', 'upon', 'thirty-one', 'dti', 'equating', 'to', 'a', 'much', 'more', 'affordable', 'amount', 'of', 'one hundred thousand', 'we', 'are', 'seeking', 'for', 'our', 'loan', 'to', 'be', 'reconsidered', 'for', 'the', 'hamp', 'program', 'we', 'are', 'seeking', 'a', 'more', 'thorough', 'and', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'as', 'to', 'why', 'we', 'are', 'being', 'overlooked', 'for', 'a', 'program', 'that', 'we', 'rightfully', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'and', 'qualified', 'to', 'receive', 'this', 'complaint', 'will', 'be', 'forwarded', 'to', 'the', 'our', 'state', 'attorney', 'general', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'michigan', 'department', 'of', 'financial', 'institution', 'for', 'their', 'review', 'of', 'my', 'grievances']"

I request that you prove that I am indeed the party who is contractually obligated to pay off this debt.   I hope you are aware that reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus  may co nstitute defamation of character. In addition, you must also be aware that until you validate this debt, you can not continue collection activities or report this information to the credit bureaus. Non-compliance with this request  may land y our company in serious legal trouble with the Federal Trade Commissi on ( FTC ) and  other state/federal agencies.   Please attach copies of the following document s : 1. Agreement with your client that authorizes you    to collect on this alleged debt.
2. Agreement that bears signature of the alleged debtor where he promises to pay the original creditor.
3. Complete payment history on this account, t  o prove that the amount you wish to collect is accurate.     In accordance with the requirements of the FCRA as stated below, I am hereby requesting your complete compliance with any and all of the provisions : *FCRA  611, Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C.    1681i ] *Requirements relating to reinsertion of previously deleted material.    *Certification of accuracy of information. If any information is deleted from a consumer 's file pursuant to subparagrap h ( A ), the information may not r einserted in the file by the consumer reporting agency unless the person who furnishes the information certifies the information is complete and accurate.   *If any information that has been deleted from a consumer 's file pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) is reinserted in the file, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing not later tha n 5 business days after the reinsertion or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Additional information. As part of, or in addition to, the notice under clause ( ii ), a consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer in writing no later than 5 business days after the reinsertion date . In responsibilities Credit Bureau is liable if fail to observe the time limits.   ( I )   a statement that the disputed information has been reinserted ; ( II ) the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted and the telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available, or of any furnisher of information that contacted the consumer reporting agency, in connection with the reinsertion of such information ; and ( III ) a notice that the consumer has the right to add a statement to the consumer 's file disputing the accuracy or completeness of the disputed information.
I received no such notification. This is a serious violation of the FCRA, and I reserve the right to pursue further action. Your agency may avoid such action by immediately deleting this listing from my credit report.
If an Item Reappears : All violations of the FCRA are treated seriously and can result in a {$1000.00} fine, payable to you, should you suc  cessfully sue the offender and win in court. Sometimes merely notifying a creditor or credit bureau of a violation is enough to get the item removed.   Should an offender refuse to cooperate with you after notification of FCRA violations, and you are not willing or able to go to court, you could report the violation to the Federal Trade Commissio n ( FTC ) or  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and let them pursue the matte r. Make sure the offender is aware you are reporting them  to  XXXX  or both of these  XXXX  agencies. When governmental agencies confront such problems, however, the consumer isnt eligible for the {$1000.00} statutory reward that might otherwise be payable should the matter be resolved in the consumers favor in court.

3,4,2,40,"This is to inform you that I 've recently pulled my credit report and noticed that there 's a collection listing from your agency on my credit report Bank of America, Account Number: XXXX . I have never been notified of this collection action or that I owed the debt. This letter is to inform you that I would like a verification of the debt and your ability to collect this money from me.   Under the FDCPA, I have the right to request a validation of this debt. I request that you prove that I am indeed the party who is contractually obligated to pay off this debt.   I hope you are aware that reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus  may  constitute defamation of character. In addition, you must also be aware that until you validate this debt, you can not continue collection activities or report this information to the credit bureaus. Non-compliance with this request may land your company in serious legal trouble with the Federal Trade Commission  ( FTC )  and other state/federal agencies.   Please attach copies of the following document  s : 1. Agreement with your client that authorizes you to collect on this alleged debt.
2. Agreement that bears signature of the alleged debtor where he promises to pay the original creditor.
3. Complete payment history on this account, to prove that the amount you wish to collect is accurate.
In accordance with the requirements of the FCRA as stated below, I am hereby requesting your complete compliance with any and all of the provisions : *FCRA 611, Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C. 1681i ] *Requirements relating to reinsertion of previously deleted material.
*Certification of accuracy of information. If any information is deleted from a consumer 's file pursuant to subparagraph ( A ), the information may n  ot reinserted in the file by the consumer reporting agency unless the person who furnishes the information certifies the information is complete and accurate.   *If any information that has been deleted from a consumer 's file pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) is reinserted in the file, the consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of the reinsertion in writing not later than  5  business days after the reinsertion or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Additional information. As part of, or in addition to, the notice under clau se ( ii ),  a consumer reporting agency shall provide to a consumer in writing no later tha n 5 bu siness days after the reinsertion date. In responsibilities Credit Bureau is liable if fail to observe the time limits.   ( I ) a statement that the disputed information has been reinserted   ; ( II ) the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted and the telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available, or of any furnisher of information that contacted the consumer reporting agency, in connection with the reinsertion of such information ; and ( III ) a notice that the consumer has the right to add a statement to the consumer 's file disputing the accuracy or completeness of the disputed information.
I received no such notification. This is a serious violation of the FCRA, and I reserve the right to pursue further action. Your agency may avoid such action by immediately deleting this listing from my credit report.
If an Item Re  appears : All violations of the FCRA are treated seriously and can result in a {$1000.00} fine, payable to you, should you successfully sue the offender and win in court. Sometimes merely notifying a creditor or credit bureau of a violation is enough to get the item removed.   Should an offender refuse to cooperate with you after notification of FCRA violations, and you are not willing or able to go to court, you could report the violation to the Federal Trade Commissi on ( FTC ) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and let them pursue the matter. Make sure the offender is aware you are reporting them to  XXXX  or  both o f these  XXXX  ag encies. When governmental agencies confront such problems, however, the consumer isnt eligible for the {$1000.00} statutory reward that might otherwise be payable should the matter be resolved in the consumers favor in court.                           As it stated in the Verification Letter from  XXXX  on    XXXX   XXXX    2017 "" If an i te m says, '' Deleted '' we have REMOVED it from your credit report and TAKEN STEPS so it does NOT REAPPEAR ''. These statement can be found as proof in the letter as provide  in Attach Docu ments.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['this', 'is', 'to', 'inform', 'you', 'that', 'i', 've', 'recently',

I have been unable to open a checking acct at ANY other institution based on a presumption published by B of A. I consider this Defamation of Character! FACTS  : 1 ) My  account was overdrawn beginning Tue sday  XX/XX/XXXX  ; this overdraft was settled w/ cash, in a branch on Monday  XX/XX/XXXX  ( {$310.00} ). B of A reported with  XX/XX/XXXX  dat e as unpaid at time of closure. This is untrue. My account was overdrawn fo r 3 bu siness days. I have already disputed this with the bank and  XXXX , with no success.    2  ) I was changing banks from  XXXX   XXXX  (  XXXX   )  to Bank of America ; both accts were open/active.    3  ) I was expecting funds in both of my B of A and  XXXX  accts over the weekend (  XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX  ) from a family member AND another source. I conducted transactions between the  XXXX  accts on what I considered deposits in transit. Due to a misunderstanding, the deposits were not made. I learned my acct was negative the morning of  XX/XX/XXXX , and due to financial hardship at the time, I was unable to resolve immediately ; my acct was  o/d 4  out of 5 days that week at B of A. My aunt was out of the country on an international cruise, returning by Sun  XX/XX/XXXX , so I thought we would talk, and fix Monday  XX/XX/XXXX . We went to the banks on Monday, and she explained to both branch managers/personal bankers, confirming that it was an oversight on her part. We deposited cash to over the overdrawn balance, again, on  XX/XX/XXXX .   I have had an active checking account with a major financial institution since  XX/XX/XXXX , It is appalling that a major financial institution can report their "" opinion '' of "" suspected fraud '', when it is defamatory in nature. I am a   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , I started and LLC and I ca n't open bank accounts at even "" 2nd chance '' banks because of one word that they have inappropriately used ... '' FRAUD ''. This has caused people to be skeptical and has hurt me financially in a number of ways. I disputed this with various departments and went to my local branch and sat down with the branch manager and walked him through all of the facts and circumstances. I conducted what I would consider non-significant transactions over the weekends based on what I considered to be deposits in transit. I resolved the problem within 4 days paid the negative balance in full. When I continued to follow-up with the branch  manager  I was finally told that they would be doing nothing, and not changing the reporting because, and I quote "" the  risk  department told me there was no business purpose for them to reverse anything ''. WOW! My 25 year career includes over 10 years of providing   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , including over 5 years with a ""  XXXX   XXXX  ''   XXXX   XXXX   and over 10 years in   XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX   the majority of which was at the   XXXX   XXXX  l.

Finally, I work very long days and often cant make it to the bank. This  XXXX  bank does not even provide the opportunity to make deposits into an ATM. How can a bank unilaterally do this to someone? To not allow them to bank with them, and report to an agency used by banks such defamatory wording ... using words that essentially "" bans '' me from opening an account at a reputable or even ""  2nd  chance '' bank.

1,9,29,25,"This new complaint relates to the complaint already in progress submitted   XXXX   XXXX   , 201  7  #  XXXX , with  Bank of America , provider of the  XXXX  card for the  State o f California temporary  XXXX  insurance program.     Summary :   XXXX   XXXX  , I noticed a transaction made with the card at  XXXX  while I was at home asleep in my bed. It was a pinned transaction made at a local ATM that I frequently have used . 6 ho urs after the transaction was made, I had discovered it, reported it, and at the directive of BOA I had called the local police and reported the transaction.     This new complaint is in regards to the willful and wanton delays in reimbursing the funds, in violation of not only the regulation cited in the original complaint   ( CFR Regulation "" e '' ) but now under the controlling attachments regarding Fiduciary Duties of Banks under the DTPA.
Timeline   :   XXXX   XXXX  , Filed Dispute With Bank   XXXX   XXXX  , Having no credit issued or reimbursement made, I called and spoke with a supervisor, ""  XXXX  '' several times. She informed me that because the transaction was "" pinned '' that there was no evidence of fraud. ( Although the notes on regul ation "" e '' specifically state that whether a transaction is pinned may not be used to determine its validity and that rather the only requirement for reimbursement is that a customer report the transaction as unauthorized within 48 hours here I reported in 6. ). Furt her,  XXXX  informed me that my own statement was not sufficient evidence that the transaction was unauthorized ( criminalizing the victim ). Further,  XXXX  informed me that this was status quo policy regarding disputes in their department at BOA, and "" she dealt with this every day and knew regulation  "" e ''  thoroughly. She also refused to connect me with any lateral or higher supervisor and would not provide contact information for a regulation compliance or legal department. She did offer to have her  manager call me within 24hours, a call I am still waiting for.      XXXX   XXXX  , I also initiated contact with this bureau to seek resolution with or without the help of the BOA disputes department.       XXXX   XXXX  , I tried calling disputes and claims department and asking for a supervisor again. She ""  XXXX  '' who conveniently seems to be the only supervisor voice at the disputes call center, promised m e a manager c all again which never came on the  XXXX  or  XXXX . I insisted that  XXXX  place the police report ( vague as it was ) that I had gathered from  XXXX  and add it to my file and reopen my claim as she had informed me that the department had already ruled my claim invalid.     On   XXXX   XXXX  , I finally made contact with the regulation compliance person from BOA   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , who informed me that she would act as a  liaison be tween the bank and I throughout the complaint process and that she would have the situation resolved by her own decided resolution date of   XXXX   XXXX  . I informed   XXXX   that this further violated regulation ""  E  '' which requires reimbursement be complete within  seven days, with a maximum customer liability of {$50.00} if timely reported. I also informe d her that the BOA card agreement presented to me when I was given the card stated that timely reporting was supported by a ""  Zero Li ability '' policy thus negating the federal allowance of {$50.00} of customer responsibility.   XXXX   did not seem to be concerned with my reimbursement ( although she did apologize ) nor the timeline.       XXXX   XXXX  , I receive to conflicting pieces of mail. First, a letter from this Bureau stating that the bank has requested more time to prepare a response and that could be 60 days. I also receive a letter from  BOA d ated   XXXX   XXXX  , which states the additional review I requested has been completed and there was no decision error found. These are highly conflicting statements ...     While my first complaint focused on the handling of my claim and the lack of reimbursement ( STILL!!!! ) in violation of CFR  "" E '', I w ould like to now file a complaint that is separate yet related to the original about the timeliness of responses indicative of a willful and wanton disregard for my consumer rights protected by federal regulation with instructive ( clearly worded  ) n otes on how to treat regulation ""  E  ''. I now wish to enforce my rights violated by  BOA  ( hereafter "" the bank '' ) enumerated by the DTPA clauses regarding Banks obligations and duties as a fiduciary.     Regulation ""  E '' i s very clear as to the requirements of its application :  1. An unauthorized transaction was made and the only stipulation that designates transactions as unauthorized is a "" reporting by the cardholder within 48 hours. '' Here I reported the charge as unauthorized and in only six hours. The bank  does not disputed this fact.    2. The regulation application notes specifically state that whether a transaction is "" pinned '' is irrelevant unless the person conducting the transaction had at one time been an authorized user and now was not. The suspect in this case was never authorized to use my card and never authorized to even possess the card, Bank of America has provided no evidence ( and can not unless they manufacture it )  that I have ever authorized anyone to use the card.    3. The maximum liability of a customer by Federal Regulation "" E '' is {$50.00}. When timely reported. Banks may create more lenient but not stricter liability on the part of the consumer. BOA did choose to be more lenient than the fed, because in my card agreement presented when I got the card, I was informed that BOA imposes "" ZERO LIABILITY '' for unauthor ized use so long as reported timely. Because the time of reporting is not in dispute,   BOA admits that I was in compliance with this policy and therefore also the more strict federal policy.
4. Regulation "" E '' requires that in any case, when timely reported, any funds removed from the customer account must be reimbursed no longer than 7   business days after the unauthorized transaction is reported.   XXXX   XXXX   from  BOA,  when I spoke to here on   XXXX   XXXX  , did not dispute the  seven d ay requirement of regulation  "" e ''. In fact she had no answer as to why this was not already reimbursed, but told me not to worry because they had determined they would provide resolution of this complaint by a promised deadline with the Bureau of   XXXX   XXXX  . Imagine my surprise when I received notice that the BOA had asked fo r additional time to prepare an answer when  XXXX  had appeased me by telling me I would have resolution by   XXXX   XXXX  .  Imagine my  further surprise to learn that BOA had already decided the second opening of this dispute against me on   XXXX   XXXX   when I received a letter to that effect today in the mail.     NEW OFFENSE : THE NEWEST VIOLATION OF BAN  K OF AMERICA IS NOT A VIOLATION OF REGULATION E, BUT RATHER A NEW PRIMA FACIE VIOLATION OF THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES ENUMERATED UNER THE DTPA.
THE VIOLATION OF THE SEVEN BUSINESS DAY REIMBURSEMENT REQUIREMENT ( STILL TOLLING ) AND IT HAS AMOST BEEN A MONTH NO  W ) WHILE BAD ENOUGH, IS NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS THE WILLFUL & WANTON ACTIONS UNDER THE DTPA, BUT I NOW SEE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE CONTINUES ACTIONS WILLFUL AND WANTON, BUT POSSIBLE WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, ADDING A PUNITIVE ELEMENT TO THE DAMAGES IMOSED UPON THE OFFENDER ( HERE BOA ).     The facts here are not disputed. I made the report to the correct department on the correct date within the time pe riod allotted by "" E ''. F urther, I was patient in allowing a grace period before I called back  XXXX  and  XXXX . What is bothering me now is that even after speaking with   XXXX   XXXX   and being further patient :  1.   I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN REIMBURSE  D 2. HER PROMISE TO ME THAT RESOLUTION WOULD OCCUR BY THE NINTH IS OBVIOUSLY BELOGNA AND THERE IS STILL NO REIMBURSEMENT OR CORRECTIVE ACTION IN PLACE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
3. BOA HAS ASKED THE BUREAU FOR MORE TIME, BUT CLEARLY BY BOA 's OWN ADMISSION THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE ANOTHER REVIEW   AND RULED NOT TO PAY IT AS DENOTED IN THE LETTER I RECEIVED. THUS BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE UNDISPUTED AS APPLIED TO THE TIMELINE, BOA 'S DECISION TO REMAIN AWARE OF MISSED OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER SOME BELIEF THAT THE CONTINUED DELAY IS ACCEPTABLE.     I FIND IT MORE DISTURBING THAT BOA 'S CONTINUED DENIAL WHEN BOA HAS UNDISPUTED  PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THE CLAIM IS LEGITIMATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH REG E. ( THE ONLY REQUIREMENT BEING TIMELY ) CONTAINS A CONFLICT OF INFORMATIO N BETWEEN SUE 'S REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL TIME TODAY AND THE LETTER I RECEIVED TODAY    XXXX      DATED   XXXX   XXXX  , SAYING THE SECONDARY EVALUATION OF THE CLAIM HAD BEEN SATISFIED.     BECAUSE OF THE WILLFUL AND WANTON DISREGARD OF THE FACTS OF THIS TRANSACTION, AND THE CHOICE OF BOA TO CONTINUE TO DENY THE CLAIM, THEY ARE CLEARLY NOW IN VIOLATION OF THE DTPA WHICH IN THE LEAST PROVIDES THAT A {$400.00} REIMBURSEMENT IS NO LONGER ACCEPTIBLE, BUT RATHER  TREBLE  DAMAGES OR IN THIS CASE {$1200.00} BECAUSE THE BANK HAD NOTICE AND CHOSE WILLFULLY AND WANTONLY TO IGNORE THE FACTS AND FAIL TO REIMBURSE THE ACCOUNT.     I NOW BELIEVE THAT SUE 'S CONTINUED DELAY AS REQUESTED TODAY, FURTHER ESCALATES MY DTPA CLAIM TO A WILLFUL AND WANTON STANDARD BUT NOW ADDING WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT.     HERE   XXXX   XXXX    NEW  OF MY COMPLAINT, NEW THAT BOA WAS IN REGULATORY VIOLATION BY FAILING TO PROVIDE RELIEF WITHIN  XXXX  BUSINESS DAYS, AND HAS FURTHER DELAYED THE PROCESS BY "" NEEDING MORE TIME TO RESPOND, WHEN CLEARLY THE LETTER MAILED WITH A   XXXX   XXXX   DATE IS  PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THAT B OA IS NOT INVESTIGATING FURTHER AS STATED. THUS  XXXX  KNOWINGLY FURTHER DEPRIVED ME OF MY ALREADY TARDY PAVEMENT AND THUS SUBJECTED HER ORGANIZATION TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN ADDITION TO MY NOW  TREBLE  DAMAGES.     PLEASE BE ADVISED IF I DO NOT RECEIVE  TREBLE D AMAGES IN MY ACCOUNT BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS TOMORROW, I DO INTEND WHOLEHEARTEDLY TO SEEK A COURT ORDER, UNDER THE DTPA AND BECAUSE I AM SO INCONVENIENCED BY THE ENTIRETY OF THE EVENT, I ASSURE YOU I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE ASSESSED WHERE NEEDED.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['this', 'new', 'complaint', 'relates', 'to',

1,8,30,35,"I used my Bank of America Visa credit card in this transaction for which I disputed the charge. I pre-ordered an aquarium from the online retailer  XXXX  in   XX/XX/XXXX  wit h an expected ship date of    XX/XX/XXXX .  M ultiple delays led to an estimated ship date of   XX/XX/XXXX , an d then finally   XX/XX/XXXX . Howe ver, the seller stopped communicating earlier in the year and I have tried multiple times to contact them through various methods such as email, online form, and chat. In addition, I moved in  XXXX  and have been unable to successfully update my shipping address. I called Bank of America initially to start a dispute and the person I spoke to on the phone said that even though this was charged in   XX/XX/XXXX  , that because the latest updated shipping wa s  XX/XX/XXXX , t hat it would be no problem and still within timeframe and she was able to initiate a dispute. I received a fax number which to fax in my request and all supporting documents. After doing so, I received a letter saying the dispute fell outside the timeframe and they can not do anything. I called in again and this time a different representative said there is nothing they can do, contrary to what I was told the first time I called . Below is  my response from a prior complaint that went unanswered : "" This requirement was not met because the transaction posting date was more than 540 days. The last date we could have entered this claim would have been   XX/XX/XXXX .  '' I called the week of   XX/XX/XXXX   and the representative on the phone said it would not be a problem initiating the dispute. This is due to the fact that the PROMISED delivery date of the purchased product was   XX/XX/XXXX . "" Therefore, we can only suggest you continue to pursue this matter directly   with the merchant to come to a satisfactory resolution. '' I obviously had tried disputing with the merchan t (  both  XXXX  the company and  XXXX  the intermediary ) and it did not work nor did they respond to me. Thus, I came to the bank for help. This has been stated in all my evidence and it is offensive Bank of America suggests this solution. It seems they either have not read/comprehended my statements or does not care. "" Bank of America respectfully denies your request for compensation, as there has been no error in the handling of your account. '' I never said there was an error in the handling of my account. This really is a purchase protection issue. I initiated the dispute because the company failed to deliver the product I bought and refuses to refund me. By denying compensation, Bank of America is saying they do not care and that I should never pre-order a product using their credit cards because if something goes wrong down  the road,  they will refuse to help. I believe Bank of America has more power to deal with the merchant  XXXX  and the intermediary   XXXX   than I. My hope was that they would recoup the loss from those companies as they probably have the resources to do so. Bank of America is the credit card I used to make the purchase and at this point the only way I can recover my money. Even under the circumstances in timing, I request to be reimbursed for my losses.     I appreciate Bank of America for refunding me the foreign transaction fee associated with this purchase, however the amount of loss to myself is still a much greater amount that I can not afford to lose. In the last response, they said "" Bank of America has followed its established credit standards, and is fully committed to adhering to all fair lending laws, and regulations. '' It 's not about just being legal, it 's about making it right for the customers who use their credit cards thinking they have the protection in case the merchant is engaging in fraud. Note that it 's bee n 2 1/2 years a nd I still have not received the product I purchased.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'used', 'my', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'visa', 'credit',

The bank just simply closed my checking account and I will not be qualified for applying for any BOA accounts in the future.

I asked whether I should apply for credit in my wife 's name only or jointly and he advised since I am the primary earner to apply jointly.     On  XXXX , I applied for a joint loan and called into Customer Service to be told that a joint application would n't be valid to do a lease buyout for my wife 's lease since if my name was not on the original lease, I could n't be on the credit application.     A few hours later on  XXXX , we did an auto application in her name only and then were told that application would not be valid since her father originally co-signed with her on the lease and that both names needed to match exactly.     So now my credit has been pinged once and my wife 's credit has been pinged twice and we have approved loans that are not valid and unable to close for the transaction advertised, given terrible advise by several loan offices and customer service agents all along the way.     I was given bad / incomplete information by the original banker and th en 2  subsequent phone representatives in order to encourage me to apply for credit without remotely trying to identify what was in my and my wife 's best interest.

1,8,30,35,"This charge was not authorized at any time and the company that made the unauthorized charge,  XXXX   XXXX , has not responded to our attempts to contact them to reverse the charges. An initial charge first made on the card was authorized, but the company did not complete work we had hired them to do as agreed upon, and this second charge was made without our permission or consent and absent any proper notification. The reason being that the work the company was hired to do was not completed as agreed upon. We agree we owe a final payment, but we do not owe {$2800.00} and should not have been charged without a renegotiation.     As is clearly indicated in highlighted portions of printed emails,  XXXX   XXXX  agrees that all the work agreed upon in the contract with them was not done and that they would agree to an adjusted ( lowe r ) final price. Instead, they charged our card for the full   amount without our permission and have avoided our calls and emails asking for this charge to be reversed.     We phoned Bank of America at the very first notice that this was charged and we informed the representative that this was an unauthorized charge. It was posted to our account anyway. In my conversations with  AAA Financial Services/Bank of America representatives on several occasions since, I was informed that we  would not be charged any late fees or penalties and that I would not have to pay until this investigation was completed.  One representative I spoke with said there would be documentation sent for us to complete, but I have not received this. I have only received bills. Please adjust your    records to reflect that this is an unauthorized charge that should not result in any late fees or penalties.
We never received any notice of any required documentation involving an alternate contractor  , nor were we informed by letter of any rejection of our case or contradictory finding of our claim. We were told by phone that the case was not resolved in our favor without any proper explanation. My last conversation with a dispute supervisor  XXXX   XXXX  on Sunday,  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , he gave me this mailing address and that perhaps someone here can help.     We sent a payment for {$2400.00}. This is the proper amount owed, and we hoped this will resolve this matter.     Specifically,  XXXX   XXXX  did not dispose of the old appliances as they were supposed to, did not clean the work site in accordance with the agreement, and installed less labor-intensive floor tiles which was both incomplete and done improperly. The overcharge transaction was not authorized at all and if we wind up in court, we are confident that any fair judge will find in our favor.     The disreputable vendor in question,  XXXX   XXXX , has been notified numerous times and his still refused to rectify this situation.     We recently sent payment for {$610.00} with the stipulation that we are making this payment under duress and only in an attempt to clear our credit rating. We fully intend to pursue this case in the courts and retrieve this money from  XXXX   XXXX .     Bank  of America/AAA Financial Services was   notified immediately that this charge was unauthorized and took no action to protect consumers from a fraudulent charge. Additionally, it agreed by cashing the check we sent earlier this year to resolve the matter with that payment and then violated that stipulation.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['this',

0,2,4,28,"My mom wrote me a check from an account she had been saving for me for college. It was a CD account so when the CD closed it transferred to her account. There was a mix up and the bank closed the account and sent my mom a check. My mom did not know this when she write me the check so it ended up returned. When I found out I tried to call the bank to catch it before anything happened, but by then they had frozen my account. I called a few times to get this resolved and kept getting referred to other departments. Now today  XXXX . XXXX .2017 I went to the branch to see what can be done. They told me the account can not be reopened, however I found out that they 've flagged me as fraud. Bear in mind no one from the bank called me to let me know this is what happened even after several attempts to find out what 's going on. This is not fraud and I can not believe Bank Of America would just close my account and flag it as fraud without finding out what 's going on. I just graduated high school and heading to college, what do I know about fraud? I strongly believe Bank Of America should confirm before destroying people 's history by labelling them as fraud. This will seriously affect me at such a young age and whereas i know they have the right to close the account, they should not be allowed to just use fraud as an excuse. I have paid the balance owed and would like Bank of America to remove that red flag from my history.

"" Please remove the following derogatory report from my credit report : Bank of America Date Reported -  XX/XX/XXXX Payment Status - 120 Days Late Account Status - Derogatory Account Number -   XXXX   Account Type - Conventional real estate mortgage Original Loan Amount - {$260000.00} Date Account Opened - XX/XX/XXXX Date Account Closed -  XX/XX/XXXX  This property was sold via the HAFA program on a short sale. The short sale was approved by BOA in writing o XX/XX/XXXX and the transaction was completed on XX/XX/XXXX .
Since it has been over 3 years from the date of sale this should no longer be reported as derogatory. This was not a foreclosure, even though we were informed by BOA on  XX/XX/XXXX  that they insist on using the foreclosure code even for short sales. Unlike other homowners who lived for years without paying their mortgage, we only missed 10 payments between  XX/XX/XXXX o  XX/XX/XXXX , prior to the short sale, after the market crashed in  XXXX . This derogatory reporting should no longer be reported as derogatory. '' I initially contacted Bank of America who advised me that I needed to contact the credit reporting bureaus. It was interesting when I spoke with BOA because they said that my account shows a foreclosure, not a short sale. I offered to provide evidence of the short sale, but they declined, stating that even a short sale is listed as a foreclosure.
<P/>
I was told by BOA as well as licensed realtors that if I did a short sale it would be on my credit report as derogatory for three years.

0,2,24,70,"My name is  XXXX   XXXX . I am having an on-going problem with Bank Of America. I feel like they have discriminated and criminalized me for things that happened within my account that simply can not control. I recently had an issue with Bank Of America where 3 months ago someone fraudulently made purchases on my account. I was accredited that money back from BOA with the assurance that everything is ok and it was evident that someone took my card and made fraudulent purchases. On my payday, I woke up to see that on  X/XX/2017    BOA waited until my direct deposit dropped and took money from that deposit to get back the money that they gave to me after someone made the fraudulent purchases. After talking to numerous BOA representatives, I 've realized that they have come to conclusion that I was the one who had been making the fraudulent purchases. Several BOA representatives have told me that in order to get my money back I will need to get a police report. With that being said I made the clear decision to take time out of my work schedule to file a police report. In the mean time I had no money but fortunately I had a check from one of my family members that I decided to cash on saturd ay (   X/XX/17    ). The check was for {$7000.00}. Now I am no stranger to how depositing checks work. It usually takes a few business days which i am aware of. But, on  X/XX/17    I woke up to an alert saying that my bank account has been $ - XXXX  insufficent and my check wouldnt get processed until a month later. I have deposited MANY checks from BOA, most of which were close to the {$7000.00} check that I deposited and it NEVER took this long. I believe that ever since the problem with the fraudulent activity BOA has been treating me unfairly. I am very upset and offended that a bank that I have invested many years into, has been treating me as if I am a criminal. Not to mention that the person who wrote me the check is a family member and is on record to have wrote me checks close to the {$7000.00} check and NONE has bounced or considered to be fraud. I would like to see all of my money back, insufficent charges off and I would like to be released from this bank. I literally have no money to get to and from work, all because BOA has decided tho treat me unfair.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['my', 'name', 'is', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'am', 'having', 'an', 'ongoing', 'problem', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'they', 'have', 'discriminated', 'and', 'criminalized', 'me', 'for', 'things', 'that', 'happened', 'within', 'my', 'account', 'that', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'i', 'recently', 'had', 'an', 'issue', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'where', 'three', 'months', 'ago', 'someone', 'fraudulently', 'made', 'purchases', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'i', 'was', 'accredited', 'that', 'money', 'back', 'from', 'boa', 'with', 'the', 'assurance', 'that', 'everything', 'is', 'ok', 'and', 'it', 'was', 'evident', 'that', 'someone', 'took', 'my', 'card', 'and', 'made', 'fraudulent', 'purchases', 'on', 'my', 'payday', 'i', 'woke', 'up', 'to', 'see', 'that', 'on', 'xxx2017', 'boa', 'waited', 'until', 'my', 'direct', 'deposit', 'dropped', 'and', 'took', 'money', 'from', 'that', 'deposit', 'to', 'get', 'back', 'the', 'money', 'that', 'they', 'gave', 'to', 'me', 'after', 'someone', 'made', 'the', 'fraudulent', 'purchases', 'after', 'talking', 'to', 'numerous', 'boa', 'representatives', 'i', 've', 'realized', 'that', 'they', 'have', 'come', 'to', 'conclusion', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'the', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'making', 'the', 'fraudulent', 'purchases', 'several', 'boa', 'representatives', 'have', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'get', 'my', 'money', 'back', 'i', 'will', 'need', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'police', 'report', 'with', 'that', 'being', 'said', 'i', 'made', 'the', 'clear', 'decision', 'to', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'work', 'schedule', 'to', 'file', 'a', 'police', 'report', 'in', 'the', 'mean', 'time', 'i', 'had', 'no', 'money', 'but', 'fortunately', 'i', 'had', 'a', 'check', 'from', 'one', 'of', 'my', 'family', 'members', 'that', 'i', 'decided', 'to', 'cash', 'on', 'saturd', 'ay', 'xxx17', 'the', 'check', 'was', 'for', 'seven hundred thousand', 'now', 'i', 'am', 'no', 'stranger', 'to', 'how', 'depositing', 'checks', 'work', 'it', 'usually', 'takes', 'a', 'few', 'business', 'days', 'which', 'i', 'am', 'aware', 'of', 'but', 'on', 'xxx17', 'i', 'woke', 'up', 'to', 'an', 'alert', 'saying', 'that', 'my', 'bank', 'account', 'has', 'been', 'xxxx', 'insufficent', 'and', 'my', 'check', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'processed', 'until', 'a', 'month', 'later', 'i', 'have', 'deposited', 'many', 'checks', 'from', 'boa', 'most', 'of', 'which', 'were', 'close', 'to', 'the', 'seven hundred thousand', 'check', 'that', 'i', 'deposited', 'and', 'it', 'never', 'took', 'this', 'long', 'i', 'believe', 'that', 'ever', 'since', 'the', 'problem', 'with', 'the', 'fraudulent', 'activity', 'boa', 'has', 'been', 'treating', 'me', 'unfairly', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'upset', 'and', 'offended', 'that', 'a', 'bank', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'invested', 'many', 'years', 'into', 'has', 'been', 'treating', 'me', 'as', 'if', 'i', 'am', 'a', 'criminal', 'not', 'to', 'mention', 'that', 'the', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'me', 'the', 'check', 'is', 'a', 'family', 'member', 'and', 'is', 'on', 'record', 'to', 'have', 'wrote', 'me', 'checks', 'close', 'to', 'the', 'seven hundred thousand', 'check', 'and', 'none', 'has', 'bounced', 'or', 'considered', 'to', 'be', 'fraud', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'see', 'all', 'of', 'my', 'money', 'back', 'insufficent', 'charges', 'off', 'and', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'be', 'released', 'from', 'this', 'bank', 'i', 'literally', 'have', 'no', 'money', 'to', 'get', 'to', 'and', 'from', 'work', 'all', 'because', 'boa', 'has', 'decided', 'tho', 'treat', 'me', 'unfair']"

0,2,4,28,"Back in 2015 Bank of America allowed my account to get over drafted. It was too my knowledge that I had overdraft protection. I went to go to bank of america to deposit the funds they had closed my account without any notification. I paid what I owed to the account that week. So I owe nothing on the account. They added me to   XXXX   XXXX   and now I can not even get a second chance account. I have called several times talking to many of the bank associates and ended with them telling me different reasons why my account was closed. Because I had overdraft, I had a   XXXX   balance when it was closed and also because I did not comply with their standards. I got no straight forward answer. I then asked them to mail me the reason and the only thing they mailed me was the notification that my accounts were being closed and not the reason why they closed them. They responded with a back dated,  XXXX   XXXX , 2015 response with my accounts closure and it stated that I did not comply with their deposit agreement and disclosure. On my   XXXX   XXXX   report it said something different, it said that I was attempting to transact in a prohibited manner. I would like to know how I was doing that because I would never do anything like that. I still do not know the reason why they closed my account.
Now it is hard trying to get a good job with that on my record. I 'm trying to start my own business and need a business checking account and no one will do business with me because of what they did to my record. Can you please help me with this issue it would be greatly appreciated.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['back', 'in', 'two thousand and fifteen', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'allowed', 'my', 'account', 'to', 'get', 'over', 'drafted', 'it', 'was', 'too', 'my', 'knowledge', 'that', 'i', 'had', 'overdraft', 'protection', 'i', 'went', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'to', 'deposit', 'the', 'funds', 'they', 'had', 'closed', 'my', 'account', 'without', 'any', 'notification', 'i', 'paid', 'what', 'i', 'owed', 'to', 'the', 'account', 'that', 'week', 'so', 'i', 'owe', 'nothing', 'on', 'the', 'account', 'they', 'added', 'me', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'now', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'a', 'second', 'chance', 'account', 'i', 'have', 'called', 'several', 'times', 'talking', 'to', 'many', 'of', 'the', 'bank', 'associates', 'and', 'ended', 'with', 'them', 'telling', 'me', 'different', 'reasons', 'why', 'my', 'account', 'was', 'closed', 'because', 'i', 'had', 'overdraft', 'i', 'had', 'a', 'xxxx', 'balance', 'when', 'it', 'was', 'closed', 'and', 'also', 'because', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'comply', 'with', 'their', 'standards', 'i', 'got', 'no', 'straight', 'forward', 'answer', 'i', 'then', 'asked', 'them', 'to', 'mail', 'me', 'the', 'reason', 'and', 'the', 'only', 'thing', 'they', 'mailed', 'me', 'was', 'the', 'notification', 'that', 'my', 'accounts', 'were', 'being', 'closed', 'and', 'not', 'the', 'reason', 'why', 'they', 'closed', 'them', 'they', 'responded', 'with', 'a', 'back', 'dated', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and fifteen', 'response', 'with', 'my', 'accounts', 'closure', 'and', 'it', 'stated', 'that', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'comply', 'with', 'their', 'deposit', 'agreement', 'and', 'disclosure', 'on', 'my', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'report', 'it', 'said', 'something', 'different', 'it', 'said', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'attempting', 'to', 'transact', 'in', 'a', 'prohibited', 'manner', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'know', 'how', 'i', 'was', 'doing', 'that', 'because', 'i', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'like', 'that', 'i', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'the', 'reason', 'why', 'they', 'closed', 'my', 'account', 'now', 'it', 'is', 'hard', 'trying', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'good', 'job', 'with', 'that', 'on', 'my', 'record', 'i', 'm', 'trying', 'to', 'start', 'my', 'own', 'business', 'and', 'need', 'a', 'business', 'checking', 'account', 'and', 'no', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'business', 'with', 'me', 'because', 'of', 'what', 'they', 'did', 'to', 'my', 'record', 'can', 'you', 'please', 'help', 'me', 'with', 'this', 'issue', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'appreciated']"
0,2,4,28,"In  XX/XX/XXXX , I received an offer in the mail from Bank Of America to open a checking account and to set up auto deposit to earn a bonus offer of {$300.00}. I opened a checking account on  XX/XX/XXXX on the computer. I set up  XXXX  auto deposits with my checking account number. In a few weeks, I received a letter from BOA about my account, a pin # and a debit card. Then, on  XX/XX/XXXX  I received a checking account statement saying that the {$25.00} that I had opened the account with had been withdrawn and my balance was  XXXX  dollars. I called the  XXXX  number on my statement and I was directed to the fraud department and then to the risk department. I was told by the risk department that my account had been closed and that I needed to open a new account. I was outraged. I expressed very clearly to the risk department that I had already set up  XXXX  auto deposits to this checking account and that I did not want to open a new account. I asked to speak to a manager and spoke to   XXXX   XXXX  . in the risk department. He told me that I could not re-open the account that was closed and that I must cancel my auto deposits and open a new checking account. I told him that I did not want to do that and asked why my account had been closed in the first place. He said that he could not tell me why. I asked to speak to a manager above him and he told me that there was no one above him. He suggested that I go into a bank branch and ask to speak to the branch manager. I went into the local branch in   XXXX   XXXX  , CA. that very day and asked to speak to the branch manager. I was told that her name is   XXXX   XXXX    and that I could come back and see her on XX/XX/XXXX . I scheduled an appointment to meet with her and did so on XX/XX/XXXX . In that meeting, I told her that I had spoken to 5 BOA employees and not a single one had offered to give me my {$25.00}!   XXXX   XXXX   told me that I should expect a check in the mail within 2 weeks. She also explained that the risk department at BOA is a separate department and that even she could not see why my account had been closed. She offered that I open a new account and I told her that I felt that I had been discriminated against and that my account had been closed and my money had been withdrawn without my consent and that I did not want to open a new account. I added that all of this had been done and no reason or explanation could be given. I told her that it was outrageous and that I was very offended. I explained that I had spent hours setting up my account, setting up the auto deposits, calling on the phone, coming into the branch and then coming back into the branch to meet with her and that I still was not being offered my {$25.00} deposit back, I was not being offered the {$300.00} offer that I was not allowed to do because they closed my account, or an explanation why I was being treated this way or an apology. She did apologize at that point and asked me if she could try and find out why my account was closed. I asked her why she had not done that before our meeting because I had let the bank receptionist know why I needed a meeting with her the day before. She could not say why other than it was hard to find out why accounts are closed. I asked to speak to a manager above her and she told me that she would have him call me and gave me his card. It is   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX   XXXX   did call me the next day, which was Saturday  XX/XX/XXXX and he told me the same thing that   XXXX   had told me. I told   XXXX   XXXX    that I can go bank anywhere but that BOA had solicited me to bank with them for a {$300.00} bonus and I did but the bank was not allowing me to earn the bonus because they had closed my account and without reason even though I have asked repeatedly and my money has not been returned to me. He explained that he would find out why my account was closed because he could do that in a limited way and that he would call me back on Monday  XX/XX/XXXX . He asked me if I would like my account reopened if the reason for BOA closing my account was not anything serious. I asked him why that was not offered to me the first time I called BOA and he said that he was the only one who could offer that. I explained to him that I was already so upset with BOA and that I had closed my auto deposits, which took my time, but that I would think about it and let him know on Monday. I assured him that there was no legitimate reason for BOA to feel that I am committing fraud against them. I assured him that I have an excellent credit score and that I only opened the account with them for the {$300.00} offer. He explained that the only way he could still give me the offer was for me to reopen my account. I told him that at this point, BOA should offer me the {$300.00} because I tried to meet the terms in good faith and they had closed my account and that I wanted my {$25.00} back. He told me that he would call me on Monday and he never got back to me. I was so upset, I did not call him on Monday and I was unsure what I should do next. I waited for my {$25.00} to be sent in the mail. I still have not received it and yesterday I received another checking statement from BOA showing that I still have an open account with them with a   XXXX   balance. That is when I decided to file a complaint here with you.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'received', 'an', 'offer', 'in', 'the', 'mail', 'from', 'bank', 'of',

0,2,4,58,"Hi,

I would like to file complaint concerning theft or loss of my money at Bank of America. Unfortunately I am not getting any help on this from Bank of America as they do not reply to any of my inquiries.

I already sent two regular-mail paper letters to Bank of America, to their headquarters. They did not respond to any of them. Bank of America does not provide any official email address at which I could contact them. They only provide a phone number to their call center which is of no help. The only email address for Bank of America which I was able to find, by luck, after an exhausting search, was executive. XXXX . I already contacted Bank of America at this address, a number of times, but they (specifically   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  ) do not reply to any of my inquiries. I AM NOT GETTING ANY HELP FROM BANK OF AMERICA on this, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONTACT THEM IN WRITING, THEY DO NOT REPLY TO MY PAPER LETTERS or EMAILS. I do not know how else to contact Bank of America, how to get them help me to get this resolved. You, CFPB, are my only help.

The problem:

Bank of America closed my account and escheated my property to State of Wisconsin (that is the information that I was able to get from Bank of America with your previous help, see case ID  XXXX ). State of Wisconsin's online Unclaimed Property Database (see   XXXX   ) does not provide any property under my name. So, I contacted State of Wisconsin Unclaimed Property Division, provided them all the necessary information and requested a MANUAL SEARCH in their Unclaimed Property Database. State of Wisconsin's response is that they cannot find anything under my name, see below:

 Dear   XXXX   XXXX  ,
 
 Thank you for contacting the
 Wisconsin Department of Revenue Unclaimed Property Unit.
 
 Our records for  XX/XX/XXXX  are all
 digital, who reported funds to us in  XX/XX/XXXX  were allow to send
 us paper copies. There are no paper records for  XX/XX/XXXX . I have
 looked under your name and I cannot find anything under your
 name. You will need to contact Bank of America, we cannot help you
 claim your unclaimed property if we cannot find it. Its
 possible Bank of America misspelled your name or make a data
 entry error when the property was sent to us. You will need
 to go back to Bank of America and talk to them. They have
 more information about the property then us.

BANK OF AMERICA SAYS THAT THEY SENT MY MONEY TO THE STATE OF WISCONSIN UNCLAIMED PROPERTY, AND THE STATE OF WISCONSIN SAYS THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY MONEY IN MY NAME FROM BANK OF AMERICA. MY MONEY IS LOST!

How this can happen in the United States of America, at a bank supervised by the Federal Reserve System??

Now I need Bank of America or the Federal Reserve System or anyone to locate where my money from my closed account is.

Thank you for your help.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['hi', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'file', 'complaint', 'concerning', 'theft', 'or', 'loss', 'of', 'my', 'money', 'at', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'unfortunately', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'getting', 'any', 'help', 'on', 'this', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'as', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'reply', 'to', 'any', 'of', 'my', 'inquiries', 'i', 'already', 'sent', 'two', 'regularmail', 'paper', 'letters', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'to', 'their', 'headquarters', 'they', 'did', 'not', 'respond', 'to', 'any', 'of', 'them', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'does', 'not', 'provide', 'any', 'official', 'email', 'address', 'at', 'which', 'i', 'could', 'contact', 'them', 'they', 'only', 'provide', 'a', 'phone', 'number', 'to', 'their', 'call', 'center', 'which', 'is', 'of', 'no', 'help', 'the', 'only', 'email', 'address', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'which', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'find', 'by', 'luck', 'after', 'an', 'exhausting', 'search', 'was', 'executive', 'xxxx', 'i', 'already', 'contacted', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'at', 'this', 'address', 'a', 'number', 'of', 'times', 'but', 'they', 'specifically', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'do', 'not', 'reply', 'to', 'any', 'of', 'my', 'inquiries', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'getting', 'any', 'help', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'on', 'this', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'possible', 'to', 'contact', 'them', 'in', 'writing', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'reply', 'to', 'my', 'paper', 'letters', 'or', 'emails', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'else', 'to', 'contact', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'how', 'to', 'get', 'them', 'help', 'me', 'to', 'get', 'this', 'resolved', 'you', 'cfpb', 'are', 'my', 'only', 'help', 'the', 'problem', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'closed', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'escheated', 'my', 'property', 'to', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'information', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'get', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'with', 'your', 'previous', 'help', 'see', 'case', 'id', 'xxxx', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 's', 'online', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'database', 'see', 'xxxx', 'does', 'not', 'provide', 'any', 'property', 'under', 'my', 'name', 'so', 'i', 'contacted', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'division', 'provided', 'them', 'all', 'the', 'necessary', 'information', 'and', 'requested', 'a', 'manual', 'search', 'in', 'their', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'database', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 's', 'response', 'is', 'that', 'they', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'under', 'my', 'name', 'see', 'below', 'on', 'tue', 'xxxxxxxx', 'dor', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'wrote', 'subject', 're', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'manual', 'search', 'request', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'date', 'tuesday', 'xxxxxxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'dear', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'contacting', 'the', 'wisconsin', 'department', 'of', 'revenue', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'unit', 'our', 'records', 'for', 'xxxxxxxx', 'are', 'all', 'digital', 'who', 'reported', 'funds', 'to', 'us', 'in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'were', 'allow', 'to', 'send', 'us', 'paper', 'copies', 'there', 'are', 'no', 'paper', 'records', 'for', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'have', 'looked', 'under', 'your', 'name', 'and', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'anything', 'under', 'your', 'name', 'you', 'will', 'need', 'to', 'contact', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'you', 'claim', 'your', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'if', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'it', 'its', 'possible', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'misspelled', 'your', 'name', 'or', 'make', 'a', 'data', 'entry', 'error', 'when', 'the', 'property', 'was', 'sent', 'to', 'us', 'you', 'will', 'need', 'to', 'go', 'back', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'talk', 'to', 'them', 'they', 'have', 'more', 'information', 'about', 'the', 'property', 'then', 'us', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'says', 'that', 'they', 'sent', 'my', 'money', 'to', 'the', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 'unclaimed', 'property', 'and', 'the', 'state', 'of', 'wisconsin', 'says', 'that', 'they', 'have', 'not', 'received', 'any', 'money', 'in', 'my', 'name', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'my', 'money', 'is', 'lost', 'how', 'this', 'can', 'happen', 'in', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'of', 'america', 'at', 'a', 'bank', 'supervised', 'by', 'the', 'federal', 'reserve', 'system', 'now', 'i', 'need', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'or', 'the', 'federal', 'reserve', 'system', 'or', 'anyone', 'to', 'locate', 'where', 'my', 'money', 'from', 'my', 'closed', 'account', 'is', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'your', 'help']"

1,8,12,85,"Bank Of America Bank of America Platinum credit card tied to my bank account on Smart Phone.     I pay my payment every month,  XXXX  month in advance, always paid on the  XXXX  of the month. But every month I was apparently receiving a late fee that was not listed on my online ( phone  )  bank statement not on the year end summary of the account.     the bank is saying the payment was due by the  XXXX  of the month, and even though I paid every month a month in advance on the  XXXX  of the month it was considered late. Only months that I made additional payments did I not receive a late fee. No where online or in statements does the account indicate that there is a windows each month that you can not make payments,  XXXX  to the  XXXX  of the month, the most frequent time people make monthly payments.     In addition the online account never shows the fee being charged for account. The fee apparently is posted on the last day of the account statement, and is not visible any other time. The online as the statement only shows the current statement period and after the next day the fee is no longer visible. The link to previous statements is deliberately hidden.  The Highlight and Underline on the text for statements has been removed so there is not way t t ell that is a link to previous statements.     Even the Year end statement deliberately does not include fees charged on the account. If you are a modern person, especially a Millennials, who maintains tracking accounts on your smart phone and use the account to ensure you pay monthly you will never know you are being charged late fees for the card. Only way you can tell what fees you are being charged is to download the monthly statement which is only way to access statements when using paperless option.     It 's was gong on for over a year., I have unknowingly paid over {$250.00} dollars in late fees. In addition and the fees change from  XXXX  dollars to  XXXX  dollars randomly.

I accepted that.     A few days later I got the wrong product. It also contained gelatin, which I 'm  XXXX  to.   I sent them an email telling them I received the wrong product, I was told to call customer service.   Being that it was a   XXXX   XXXX  , my mom said to forget about it. She would take the pills.   I thought that would be the end of it.   A few days later I was checking my bank statement and saw to transactions that I had not made.  XXXX  of them for {$79.00} and another  XXXX  for {$69.00}. I was waiting for them to be posted so I could contact the bank ( they were still pending ).   When I called the ban k ( B ank of America ) I was told to call them, the scammers, and ask for a returner address and return the product being that it was never opened and to close my account. When I called the scammers on  XXXX   XXXX  they said there was nothing they could to about it, they do n't accept returns and I was outside of the two week trial. I did n't even know there was a two week trial. That said that when I signed up for it I was accepting to be billed every month. I would have never signed up for it if I had known, I would have paid a few extra dollars and ordered it off of  XXXX .   I was offered a 50 % refund, I kept on fighting over the phone, then a 75 % refund and that was all that could be done. I kept on telling him how it was all wrong, etc. They are scamming people, ripping them off and that 's just not right. I asked them to close any account I did not open with them so that I would never be charged again.   I called my bank back and the person who attended me said that I should just take it, being that there was fine print that they probably would n't be able to do anything about it and I would n't get anything back.   Now I 'm waiting to get my {$110.00} refund.   I still want the other {$37.00} + shipping. I never even received the proper product.

0,2,20,82,"I noticed my Debit Card was missing and called the bank I believe the morning of  XX/XX/XXXX . I went on line and noticed that my account was over drawn at that point and told the Bank Rep to immediately cancel my card as it was stolen and used. My   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   was also stolen ... .I did get my truck back around the end of  XXXX  thanks to the help of the   XXXX   XXXX   Police Department . Everything my partner and I had inside was stolen but thank   XXXX   no damage to the vehicle.
Two days after I reported the card I called the bank asking how long it would be before I got my new card. The gentleman said about a week to 10 days and asked why I have n't cancelled my old card! I told him I did ... and he said whoever took the first report did not cancel the stolen card so that number could still be used ... but since the account was over drawn it was n't used any more. The did send my new card and told me they would update the account with all this information and get back to me.
I did n't know that I had to check my message box in my bank app to get these reports ... I noticed the reports late but was able to fill out the proper forms. Then on  XX/XX/XXXX  I received another message to file the fraud statement which I did.
On  XX/XX/XXXX  a message stated the temporary credit would be reversed on  XX/XX/XXXX . I immediately called the fraud department and they had my NEW CARD NUMBER as currently being used and that is the reason for denying the claim. I told her they have the CARDS MIXED UP ... so the Bank Rep took down that information and said they would add to report and get back with me. Then I receive another message on  XX/XX/XXXX  that they would be reversing the temporary credit as they determined that no error has occurred and claim is resolved! HOW? WHY I asked ... then the letter said the transaction activity in question was authorized as they used my pin ... I told the rep my PINS and Passwords are in my phone! I DID NOT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO USE MY CARD! Just like I did not give my keys to someone to steal my truck and possessions for almost a month ... that is why I called the police.
I had a business check taken from the middle of our check book for our business a few years ago and we were INSURED when someone stole from our bank account. Why is this any different. I never overdraw my account. I have a   XXXX   XXXX  , I am a   XXXX   XXXX   for some High End Customers and I work part time at a   XXXX   XXXX   ... I never overdraw my accounts and always pay my bills on time!
One of the last messages dated  XX/XX/XXXX  stated by the bank "" We 're here to help '' - "" If you have any questions or would like to request copies of the documents we relied on to reach this decision, please call us at   XXXX   ''. I did and asked the gentleman that I would like copies of the documents and he said there are no documents! WOW ... NO DOCUMENTS ... then how did you arrive at this decision???
I asked for copies of the pictures from any ATM 's and they said they do n't get those only if the card was used at their Bank. I know ATM 's have pictures ... I have seen it on the news and TV. They simply did nothing! WHY do I have to take the beating? Am I not INSURED or protected somehow??? I asked to speak to his boss ... His name is   XXXX   and he said the name of his boss is   XXXX   XXXX   and she would get back with me in 48 hours or another one of his managers.
Thank you for helping in this matter. I work hard and {$660.00} is a lot of money to me. Please let me know what else you need from me to support your review.
I am attaching copies of the messages from the bank for review.

1,8,1,48,"I  applied for a zero percent apr purchase card with BofA online. My application came back declined because I had a block on my credit. I tried calling numerous times to speak to someone and I could not get anyone to look at my application so I simply dismissed it. A couple of days later I received a call from BofA from an analyst that said if we can call the credit bureau we can get this credit card approved. We called and they approved my credit card. A couple of days later I received the card WITHOUT the promotion of zero percent purchase interest. I have called and spent hours on the phone with them and they said I do n't  qualify for the card with that promotion. If I did n't qualify for the card that I applied for then why was n't this communicated with me at the time of the application or when I spoke to the analyst to verify the product I applied for? If I was approved for another c ard ( one that I never applied for ) then why was n't this told to me in order for me to make a decision on  how to proceed? Instead, I get a card with a high interest rate that I never applied for nor that I wanted. This seems like a misleading practice to offer something to someone and then deliver another product that the customer does not want. I spoke to  XXXX   XXXX  in resolutions who was not able  to help and refused to allow me to speak to someone to file a complaint. I was told a manager would call me back and no one has to this point.

6,11,27,99,I submitted a form for auto payments during the first months of my auto loan. I sent the first payment because it states to make payments until the auto pay begins I thought my auto payments because on their Bank of America it did n't show a payment was due.     I was never notified that I had missed a payment.     They state that they tried to contact me but I have no voicemails or email notifications that told me my payment had not been made.     I believe this is unfair because on their website they have payment alerts that tell me when a payment is due. Apparently it only shows when credit card payments are due not auto loans. No where does it state that. I was under the impression that if a payment was due it would show an alert. it did n't.     They told me that have time stamps of me logging in before the 30 day late payment.

In  XXXX  of  XXXX  he gets no warning what so ever and the BOA took that {$400.00} out of his account leaving him negative and without any $ $ going on a week now. BOA states they sent a letter after the money was taken from his account but we have not received it. I have called the bank several times and each time I am on the phone re-explaining my story over and over with no help. My calls are lasting anywhere from 40-60 mins. Instead of listening to me they keep trying to tell me the check image was not clear ( mobile picture ) so it was returned and the $ $ taken back. The problem being the mobile deposit did not go through we never received an extra {$400.00}. We only received on {$400.00} deposit from physical check. This is absolute insanity. This caused the account to be negative and left us with no $ $ in the account for almost a week now.

0,2,20,47,"Bank of America has made it very difficult to access funds direct-deposited into my checking account. I recently had to travel across the country to deal with a family death, and wanted to move some funds to a credit union I 've been a member of for decades. That way I could avoid traveling with a large amount of cash, and would have access to the funds at a familiar location at my destination. My first plan was to write a check on my Bank of America account and deposit it to my credit union, in time for it to clear before my arrival. However, BANK OF AMERICA HAS NEVER SENT ME A SET OF CHECKS FOR THIS ACCOUNT. I am perplexed as to how a "" checking account '' does not come with checks. Next I looked into transferring funds, but Bank of America charges {$3.00} to transfer funds to another institution. I have never encountered such a fee. As I prepared to leave town, I started to panic that I would not have money when I got there. Finally, going through all my new-account materials, I found one single temporary check that looked fake and unofficial, and used it for lack of other options. Meanwhile, I did n't realize that my wife tried to help me out of the stressful situation by withdrawing from a Bank of America ATM near her office, and deposited the cash into our credit union immediately before I left. Had I known that day, I would have stopped the temporary check, but I did n't know we had duplicated efforts for a day or two. The temporary check bounced and Bank of America assessed a {$35.00} fee for the returned check. When we discovered the problem we immediately made a big deposit into the Bank of America account to cover it and ensure the account is in good status. Then I contacted Bank of America to explain how it occurred, and asked them to waive the fee. The Bank refused, and still has not sent me pre-printed checks for this checking account. Bank of America seems to set its customers up for failure by making it difficult to transact without fees. So I am asking the CFPB 's help.

I called them to ask what this is, and they said that this is for the merchant service terminal that I currently have, even though I have n't had this service for 2 years. I told them that I returned all my equipment, and that it should automatically be cancelled once they received it. They advised that after I returned the equipment, I was supposed to call them and personally tell them to cancel the service, even though they never told me this. How does this make sense? If I do n't have your equipment nor your service, how are you still charging me for leasing your equipment? This is the same thing as leasing a vehicle, returning it when the lease is up, but they still charge me every month for the vehicle because I did n't call them to cancel it. This is FRAUD.  <P/> I spoke to many different people from  BofA, includin g supervisors and managers.

I called  XXXX   XXXX  and they did indeed see the charges, but confirmed that it was BofA sending the charges. So we conference c alled BofA  with  XXXX   XXXX  and they exp  lained to BofA that this was Bank of America sending the charges, and BofA agreed.
<P/>  BofA finally can celled ( last month in  XXXX  ) th e services that I never had for 2 years, but I need them to refund me all of the money that they 've been withdrawing from my account in the past 2 years. This is fraud. They 've literally been stealing money from my bank account for services I never had. This is similar to the  XXXX   XXXX  case, and will not be tolerated.  <P/> I will take this to court if it 's not resolved here.

1,8,31,37,"Last year I called Bank of America for  two  of my accounts, to try to set up a payment arrangement as I was having financial problems due to health and paying my moms rent. They said they set me up, but nothing happened. I called them and they said they could not help but sent me a letter. I asked for another letter, which they sent. All it said was We are unable to assist you. Literally that 's it.     So about 4 months ago, I spoke with someone who said if I set up regular payments to come out automa tically, after three months my accounts would be reeaged. I have made the three payments all on time, and they have not reaged my accounts. They are falling far ther and farther behind, and now the payments to bring it up to date are way out of what I can afford.     All I want from this company is for them to honor what they have said and bring my accounts up to date with a reage. Not working with me at all on this and lying everytime I ask for help has ruined my ability to bring the account up to date, and is ruining my credit. I know there are delinquencies on there that are my fault when I was unable to pay. However, I think all the last ones should be removed, and reage the accounts as promised.   Listen to the phone call from about 4 months ago. It was obviously with a newbie, as I was put on hold over and over to check answers, but she was being coached. I did n't think this company would have these unfair tactics again. Please listen to your reps and what they told me, and then just reage my account, so I can try to salvage my credit. RESPONSE BY USPS MAIL ONLY PLEASE. I want proof of everything from now on. I requested no more calls to my cell phone, and I want no more calls to my cell phone. BUT I WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE FOR A CHANGE. You are being unfair and just rude for treating me like this. Is it because I do n't make enough money? I 'm too poor for your bank? That 's what I think, even though you are charging me ridiculous fees and interest even while I was supposed to be in a program.

1,8,5,28,"I had  XXXX  credit cards with Bank of America, both were Visa cards, one ending in  XXXX  and the other in  XXXX . Both were issued in  XXXX .
<P/>
Both credit cards were always in good standing, and were always paid on time. I also never went over the credit limit on either one of my credit cards, and they were used frequently for basic needs, and always paid on time.
<P/>
Between XX/XX/XXXX  and XX/XX/XXXX , Bank of America closed both of my credit card accounts without any notification whatsoever. Notifications were sent afterwards, which I received today. I still have a balance on my cards, but can not use any of them. Now, this information will adversely affect my credit which I have been working on rebuilding for years, and  XX/XX/XXXX  accounts will be listed as closed accounts. If I had been given the opportunity to pay off the balance in order to at least keep the accounts open to build "" credit history '', as most credit scoring systems consider this an important factor on building credit, I would have paid them off. But the opportunity was not given, nor was any notice given prior to this occurring.
<P/>
According to the letter received today, but dated  XX/XX/XXXX , the date the accounts were closed, the decision of closing these accounts was based on "" account history, your total relationship with us, current economic trends and a copy of your credit report ''.

Several times throughout the call I emphasized to the Representative I only wanted a credit limit of {$2000.00}. Now a week later I look at my balance online and of course it is a {$10000.00} limit. The Representative did the exact opposite from what I requested for her financial benefit. I will be in the market for a refinance before the end of the year and want my debt to income to be as low as possible so I can qualify for the best loan.

1,8,36,19,"I have an   XXXX   XXXX   Visa card through Bank of America.
 XXXX 
It had a {$17000.00} limit that was reduced without explanation on  XX/XX/XXXX  down to {$3200.00}. My balance at the time was {$3100.00}.
 XXXX 
I had n't used my card since approximately  XX/XX/XXXX  and it had a {$0.00} balance. ( I have always paid the balance in full monthly and I only use the card once or twice a year for travel ).
 XXXX 
I received a bill in XX/XX/XXXX  that included my {$0.00} balance and what I think was a new {$85.00} annual fee. I did not pay the bill cause I knew I was going to use the card in the next couple of weeks so I would pay it when I returned from my international trip coming up.
 XXXX 
I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX  to let them know I was going to be out of the country and using the card as my main and only form of payment from  XX/XX/XXXX  through  XX/XX/XXXX . They confirmed this action and I assumed everything was set and ready to go.
 XXXX 
I successfully used the card multiple times internationally on my trip until receiving a fraud alert text after getting my card denied purchasing a {$15.00} waterproof phone case in    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  ,  XXXX  on   XX/XX/XXXX . I confirmed the purchase through the fraud text alert and my card worked again moments later.
 XXXX 
I again used the card without issue numerous times over the next week and a half.
 XXXX 
My card was then declined a t   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   on   XXXX   XXXX   on  Monday, XX/XX/XXXX . The restaurant tried running the card twice. I received no immediate follow up text for an explanation or asking a question, no e-mail, no phone call or anything explaining why it was declined.
 XXXX 
I ended up having to call using my cell phone ( international calling ) and spent 45 minutes trying to figure out why my card was deactivated. I was transferred three times and had to repeat my situation each time to the person I talked to. I ended up paying for lunch with cash.
 XXXX 
I was told by bank of america customer service that due to missing a payment ( I used the card for the first time just two weeks earlier ), the system had deactivated my card and would n't allow them to reactive it until the next business day. I explained how it was my only form of funds, stuck at a restaurant without money, and I was traveling internationally like I had told them on the phone two weeks earlier. I reminded them I still needed to pay for lunch and the hotel that night.
 XXXX 
After 45 minutes on the phone I was told my card was now reactivated and ready to use. I had already paid for lunch with cash at that point and finished the conversation on the ferry.
 XXXX 
When I reached my hotel, I went to use the card and it was, again, declined. I, again, received no text or contact explaining the dispute or denial of service.
 XXXX 
I did not want to deal with customer service again so I contacted my mom in the US and we were able to get the room paid for.
 XXXX 
My balance on the card at the time was around {$3100.00} and my credit limit was {$17000.00}.
 XXXX 
Luckily, I was able to return to the US without trying to use the card again, although it left me in serious stress knowing I had to travel home without access to viable funds that I am entitled to in my card agreement.
 XXXX 
I received an e-mail on  XX/XX/XXXX  that my credit limit had been lowered from {$17000.00} to {$3200.00}. I received no explanation and no further contact.
 XXXX 
I received a bill on  XX/XX/XXXX  that listed a {$27.00} fee and {$12.00} in interest charges. I had only been using the card for the last 3 weeks and had never received a statement with any purchases listed on it.
 XXXX 
I find it incredibly unethical, immoral and unnaceptable that a credit card company would treat a customer this way.
 XXXX 
I have never missed a payment on a credit card in 15+ years. I have never had my credit limit lowered before, let alone from {$17000.00} down to {$3200.00} when my balance is at {$3100.00} ( Was {$0.00} on  XX/XX/XXXX ) and they know I 'm traveling out of the country and using the card as my only funds.
 XXXX 
After getting no explanation from customer service for treating me this way after spending what was probably more than 30 minutes on the phone, I ended the call and thought this behavior needed to be reported.
 XXXX 
No customer should be treated the way I was treated and Bank of America should be required to change their policies so they do n't put their customers lives in danger by cancelling their only form of payment while in a foreign country. They knew I was there and had no right to cancel my card or lower my credit line.
 XXXX 
I contacted them to tell them I was traveling out of the country before starting to use my card. They contacted me about possible fraud when I was traveling and I immediately returned their text so they knew how to contact me. They then cancelled my card when I was traveling ( knowing it was my only form of payment and without explanation ) and forced me to call collect to resolve it. They said they resolved it but then my card was denied again that evening at my hotel. I had to contact my mom internationally to figure out another form of payment. I finally received a bill today and it showed a {$27.00} fee and over {$12.00} in interest. Those are fraudulent practices. I had n't even been using the card for three weeks and was already being charged fees, interest, having my card cancelled, and my credit lowered by over {$14000.00} without explanation.
 XXXX 
If I did n't have some cash and the ability to contact my mom, the outcome of me not having any way to buy things could have been drastic. This sort of treatment of a customer is unacceptable, especially to someone with a very good credit history.
 XXXX 
Banks ca n't play with customers lives like this. I demand a detailed explanation from Bank of America so I can start to understand why they would drop the ball so severely.
 XXXX

3,13,34,101,"My mortgage payment with Bank of America has never been late for 11 years. During the month of   XXXX   XXXX  , I made a change to the automatic payment of my mortgage. The change resulted in my mortgage payment being not credited to the loan account, but to a Bank of America 's credit card account. Due to that mistake, my mortgage payment was delinquent on   XXXX   XXXX   for more than 30 days.
<P/>
Until   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , I was not informed by Bank of America by phone or written notice regarding the delinquency. The only reason I found out of the delinquency was because a service that I use,  XXXX , informed of a drop on my credit history rate.
<P/>
I called Bank of America on the same date,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , and explained the situation. Bank of America never informed me that I could have retroactively transfer the credits I have on my Bank of America credit card to my Mortgage account with Bank of America. I made the payment over the phone on that same call on   XXXX   XXXX  , and they also refunded all fees related to late fees. On that recorded phone call, on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , I was informed by the Bank of America associate that there were no records of attempted calls from the collection department to inform me of the delinquency.
I also did not received any written notice from Bank of America before   XXXX   XXXX   informing on the delinquency of   XXXX   XXXX  .
<P/>
My credit payment history is impecable with all companies I have applied for credit.
My credit rating was above 800 in almost all Credit Report Agencies. That mortgage delinquency reported by Bank of America made my credit report to drop around 200 points. It took me more than 17 years to build an impecable credit history. Bank of America reported a delinquency without good faith efforts attempts to contact me, violated a RESPA regulation ( 12 CFR 1024.39 ( a ) ) and my rights as a consumer. My voice mail on my phone estates my name and request the called to leave a message. I never receive any voice mail from Bank of America.
<P/>
I have records of the credit card account holding the credit amount due on my mortgage ( I did not owe any amount on the credit card on XX/XX/XXXX  so the payment done was applied as a credit to my credit card account ). The date of this payment is the same date of the mortgage due,  XX/XX/XXXX .
It was clearly a mistake on my part, but I am not a number. I am a good consumer with an impecable payment history, not having any late payment or delinquency in 11 years of mortgage.
<P/>
Bank of America did not make any attempt to contact me by phone, mail or email within 36 days of my mortgage delinquency, which is a RESPA violation ( 12 CFR 1024.39 ( a ) ).

1,8,19,2,"I accepted a balance transfer offer from Bank of America i n  XX/XX/XXXX , an d opened with them a Credit Card ending in  XXXX . In mi d  XX/XX/XXXX  I received a  standard email from Bank of America about payment received to my Credit Card with them, just saying thank you for your payment, as usual. My Credit card is on autopay, and monthly payments are automated bank to bank.   Then later that month I received a separate email from  XXXX  ( which I use to monitor my credit ) stating that there has been a negative report of delinquent payment on my Bank of America credit card. I went to the bank of America web service to see what was going on in my account, there I saw my payment had gone through without a glitch, nothing else on my credit card account.     Since I do n't have much time to manage these things, my Credit card has been on autopay since I can remember. I was able to get back on the web and see my bank of America credit card account la ter in  XX/XX/XXXX , the re I found a strange (  ledger styl e ) set of boxes to tick and allegedly confir m one b y one all my credit card payments ever made to the Bank of America Credit Card. I found this odd, but anyway I dedicated to it as much time as possible to confirm the last few years of payments one by one to this credit card. I checked that my autopay was still operational and decided to make the time and make a phone call to the company asap.     Then I received a letter from Bank of America stating in general terms that due to recent changes in circumstances, I did n't know what changes or by whom, but anyway it was their letter and their decisions, that my credit limit was being decreased by {$1700.00}. Nothing else on such letter.     Within a day or two, I got another email from  XXXX , now I appeared as delinquent in payments fo r 30 a nd 60 days with Bank of America. I went back to the Bank of America Website to see my account, there I confirmed that my Credit limit had been reduced and that m y  XX/XX/XXXX  autopay payment had gone through without a hitch, but there was a request that I pay over {$500.00} in arrears for  XX/XX/XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX . I picked up the phone and called the  number on the back of the Credit Card.     After a bit of digging, th e CS repre sentative for Bank of America explained to me that apparently my minimum payment had gone up, since I was up to then on a "" reduced payment amount '' for their balance transfer offer. That was something no one ever contacted me about, and was not on my account at the Bank of America website. I had set up a monthly payment that was minimum payment plus {$20.00}. The explanation was that since that minimum payment amount apparently changed, the amount on autopay did not cover what the bank wanted to receive sin ce  XX/XX/XXXX , but th ey failed to notify me in any way. So I paid the agent the full amount she asked for over the phone, and set up a new autopay amount f or  XX/XX/XXXX .    The Bank of America Customer Service agent assured me that since she understood that this was a technical glitch on the Bank 's end, and the credit card was on Autopay, I should have been contacted and it was a technical error, not a failed payment by me- the client, as was reported to the credit bureaus. She assured me that the error would be corrected, the negative report would be erased from my credit history, and all would be fixed with their apologies.     Instead, what happened was that the bank reported to the credit bureaus that I had finally made the late payments, and they went ahead and closed my credit card, leaving me with a an outstanding debt on a credit card that has been cancelled by them. I found out about the Credit Card being closed through the Credit Bureaus, not by a bank notification. The bank actively destroyed my Credit instead of correcting the error. That was not what was agreed, and definitely hurt my credit on a credit card that was on autopay. This needs to be rectified.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'accepted', 'a', 'balance', 'transfer', 'offer', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'i', 'n', 'xxxxxxxx', 'an', 'd', 'opened',

We deposited the check into our JOINT Checking Ac  count . ( Bank of America ) Within 12 hours there was thousands of dollars being processed/withdrawn out of our JOINT Checking Account. The company that withdraw the monies, was n't indicated at all in our JOINT Checking Account statements. There was no ALERT! that was indicated to us with our online Accounts at all.   <P/> Of course, we immediately went to the closest Bank of America to see what on earth was going on with this particular account mentioned above.  <P/> 
The Bank of America Manager found out that it was a Credit Card issued back in the early  XX/XX/XXXX  through my husbands company which has been CLOSED since XX/XX/XXXX . They indicated that    the last payment wa s XX/XX/XXXX . The  Credit Card was through the company which was also a LLC. My husbands name was the ONLY name on the Credit Card. Not mine.  <P/> The monies that were withdrawn is also mine. Th e Checking Account is also a JOINT Acc ount.  XXXX  Bank of America fraudulently withdrawn monies out of a   JOINT Checking Account  XXXX   XXXX   Please note, there was no notice by mail or phone calls to Alert us of any problem or issues to resolve any matters with Bank of America.

I was told to contact the dealer to find out. I called the dealer, but was unable to reach anyone. Then, I called the bank back to see if I could get a better response.  Low  and behold I was able to reach a nice lady who took time out of her busy day to help me get to the bottom of things. She was able to locate my loan documents and agreed that the loan document indicated that my balance should have been lower than what they had in the system. She told me she was going to submit a research request to get it all straightened out. She gave me a confirmation number and told me that someone may reach out to me if they had any questions or needed further information. After I got off the phone with the bank, the dealership called me back. Since the lady at the bank told me that she was working on a resolution, I told the dealership that and they went ahead and considered the issue being handled.

No additional fees, no less than the agreed upon amount. I believe that this discrepancy is a Regulation Z violation and should be handled as such.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'thursday', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'contacted', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'the', 'bank', 'to', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'my', 'principal', 'balance', 'differed', 'from', 'what', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'it', 'was', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'when', 'i', 'signed', 'the', 'documents', 'at', 'the', 'dealership', 'because', 'all', 'the', 'guy', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'entered', 'into', 'the', 'system', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'to', 'contact', 'the', 'dealer', 'to', 'find', 'out', 'i', 'called', 'the', 'dealer', 'but', 'was', 'unable', 'to', 'reach', 'anyone', 'then', 'i', 'called', 'the', 'bank', 'back', 'to', 'see', 'if', 'i', 'could', 'get', 'a', 'better', 'response', 'low', 'and', 'behold', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'reach', 'a', 'nice', 'lady', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'out', 'of', 'her', 'busy', 'day', 'to', 'help', 'me', 'get', 'to', 'the', 'bottom', 'of', 'things', 'she', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'locate', 'my', 'loan', 'documents', 'and', 'agreed', 'that', 'the', 'loan', 'document', 'indicated', 'that', 'my', 'balance', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lower', 'than', 'what', 'they', 'had', 'in', 'the', 'system', 'she', 'told', 'me', 'she', 'was', 'going', 'to', 'submit', 'a', 'research', 'request', 'to', 'get', 'it', 'all', 'straightened', 'out', 'she', 'gave', 'me', 'a', 'confirmation', 'number', 'and', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'someone', 'may', 'reach', 'out', 'to', 'me', 'if', 'they', 'had', 'any', 'questions', 'or', 'needed', 'further', 'information', 'after', 'i', 'got', 'off', 'the', 'phone', 'with', 'the', 'bank', 'the', 'dealership', 'called', 'me', 'back', 'since', 'the', 'lady', 'at', 'the', 'bank', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'she', 'was', 'working', 'on', 'a', 'resolution', 'i', 'told', 'the', 'dealership', 'that', 'and', 'they', 'went', 'ahead', 'and', 'considered', 'the', 'issue', 'being', 'handled', 'the', 'following', 'day', 'friday', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'received', 'a', 'phone', 'call', 'from', 'a', 'rep', 'at', 'the', 'bank', 'but', 'we', 'ended', 'up', 'playing', 'phone', 'tag', 'and', 'never', 'had', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'connect', 'on', 'monday', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'received', 'a', 'letter', 'from', 'the', 'bank', 'informing', 'me', 'that', 'they', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'to', 'reach', 'me', 'but', 'they', 'were', 'unsuccessful', 'and', 'i', 'needed', 'to', 'contact', 'them', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'issue', 'resolved', 'i', 'called', 'them', 'back', 'on', 'tuesday', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'at', 'which', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'i', 'needed', 'to', 'contact', 'the', 'dealership', 'to', 'get', 'the', 'issue', 'resolved', 'i', 'contacted', 'the', 'dealership', 'again', 'to', 'no', 'avail', 'the', 'issue', 'is', 'a', 'lack', 'of', 'assistance', 'in', 'getting', 'a', 'disclosure', 'discrepancy', 'resolved', 'i', 'signed', 'a', 'security', 'agreement', 'agreeing', 'to', 'pay', 'the', 'stated', 'principal', 'balance', 'and', 'that', 'is', 'what', 'i', 'want', 'to', 'pay', 'no', 'additional', 'fees', 'no', 'less', 'than', 'the', 'agreed', 'upon', 'amount', 'i', 'believe', 'that', 'this', 'discrepancy', 'is', 'a', 'regulation', 'z', 'violation', 'and', 'should', 'be', 'handled', 'as', 'such']"

XXXX   XXXX , Texas, Payee : The  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , Notation : Dealer Reserve  XXXX   XXXX . When we first learned that our reserve funds were no longer on deposit in the  XXXX  bank, it would not tell us where the money was -- and it took us years to find it. Our corporation is a North Carolina corporation, yet we discovered  that BofA wrongly escheated our funds to the Texas Comptroller. Compounding this error is that BofA failed to include both our last known address and our federal tax ID number, information that the Texas Property Code requires that the Texas Comptroller receive with escheated funds. The Texas Comptroller requested the omitted information, and it w as refused. The  XXXX  bank would like for our funds to be returned to it, but the Texas  Comptroller refuses to do so. Early this month Texas Asst. Attorn ey General  XXXX   XXXX  asked BofA to provide her with the omitted information, and it again refused. The fact that adults would engage in thi  s Catch 22 situation is silly because BofA might be too big to fail, but it is not above the law of either the United States or the State of Texas. The obligation to return our reserve funds lies squarely and singularly with BofA, and we have every right to insist that it pay us our funds. Then it can deal with the Texas Comptroller in an effort to recover the funds that it sent there. We no longer want to be in the middle of this circus. We submit that BofA and the Texas Comptroller have enjoyed the interest-free use of our funds for much too long already, and now we want to receive payment of our funds.
If you wish, you may consider this complaint to also be a claim against DIF for deposits unquestionably owed by BofA to T  he  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , a North Carolina corporation, and which Bank of Americ a, N.A., has declined to pay on demand. We have no obligation to chase our funds cross-country as a result of BofA having committed multiple errors, nor ought we to have to pay a host of legal expenses to recover our funds after such errors and subsequent default by BofA. BofA has the first obligation to pay us, and FDIC shares that responsibility for our insured funds.

0,16,20,81,"I had an automated mortgage payment throughout the year of  XXXX , and inexplicably, the payment set for XX/XX/XXXX  did not process. I did not receive notice from the mortgage servicer until it was 30 days past due, severely impacting my previously   XXXX   XXXX  . I have statements from earlier in  XXXX  showing the automated payment was run monthly in the amount of   XXXX  . Upon learning of this, I instantly made a double payment of  XXXX  ( for  XX/XX/XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX  ) on  XX/XX/XXXX , and restarted the automated payment for  XX/XX/XXXX .
Interestingly,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , lying, useless member of the Bank of America crime family, pointed out in her reply only that I started the automated payment for  XX/XX/XXXX , refusing to acknowledge that the payment had been automated leading up to  XX/XX/XXXX , despite evidence in prior statements that it was. Interestingly,   XXXX   XXXX    conveniently did not provide the  XX/XX/XXXX  statement, which would have showed the automated payment to be in effect leading up to  XXXX , because it would have been incriminating.
When I pointed this out, she said the online banking history data was unavailable, refused to discuss it further, and said the bank would not change its position regardless, and would not provide evidence of who discontinued my payment ( I received no confirmation of discontinuation and I maintain that I did not make this change ). She kept asking if I had further questions, then refused to answer them when they were posed.
If I discontinued the payment, as they claimed in the past while refusing to provide the evidence, why not provide the evidence to me and shut me up? And if they admit the error and notify the mortgage servicer, I would be satisfied, and it will not affect their license to steal at all. I do n't think anything would affect that!!
If Criminal Bank of America does not have this data, they are violating records retention regulations which I have verified as governing online banking data. The required retention period of 7 years has not expired. She was unfazed and said the case was closed and she would provide no further assistance. She should be fired ( which the crime syndicate obviously wo n't do because she is aiding in covering up their misdeeds ), prohibited from working in the banking industry, and either be subject to banking industry sanctions or criminal prosecution, if applicable.
I implore the CFPB to require to Criminal Bank of America to provide the evidence I have requested, or for the CFPB to either investigate the records retention violations, or refer this matter to the OCC.
This case should be forwarded to a different member of the criminal syndicate.   XXXX   XXXX  , who explicitly refused to address this issue honestly and fairly, has proven herself to be unfit for a compliance position, and probably just about any other form of employment.

I had  an   XXXX   XXXX    Credit Card charge of {$4.00} and another restaurant charge ( was still pending final amount ). Once those  XXXX  charges have posted, I was hit by an overdraft overnight. It usually shows a negative number ( marke d in Red ), and this gives the chance for me to go and deposit some money to bring that number back to positive.      On the other hand, my account cut off time is  XXXX   XXXX  ET ( While I am living in California ). This should be always  Pacific Time a ccording to my residence. So Whenever I need to protect myself from account overdraft, I always have to think of Eastern Time which is  3 hrs ahead of Pacific Time. ( While I am living in California ). Its definitely frustrating.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['bank', 'of', 'america', 'charged', 'me', 'an', 'overdraft', 'fee', 'for', 'the', 'account', 'being', 'overdrawn', 'by', 'couple', 'of', 'dollars', 'they', 'charged', 'a', 'hefty', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'for', 'that', 'usually', 'other', 'banks', 'do', 'nt', 'charge', 'you', 'such', 'overdraft', 'fee', 'if', 'the', 'account', 'is', 'withdrawn', 'by', 'five hundred', 'or', 'less', 'this', 'is', 'definitely', 'deceiving', 'the', 'other', 'thing', 'is', 'that', 'it', 'did', 'nt', 'even', 'show', 'any', 'negative', 'balance', 'so', 'i', 'can', 'go', 'and', 'deposit', 'some', 'funds', 'to', 'cover', 'this', 'overdraft', 'i', 'had', 'an', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'credit', 'card', 'charge', 'of', 'four hundred', 'and', 'another', 'restaurant', 'charge', 'was', 'still', 'pending', 'final', 'amount', 'once', 'those', 'xxxx', 'charges', 'have', 'posted', 'i', 'was', 'hit', 'by', 'an', 'overdraft', 'overnight', 'it', 'usually', 'shows', 'a', 'negative', 'number', 'marke', 'd', 'in', 'red', 'and', 'this', 'gives', 'the', 'chance', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'go', 'and', 'deposit', 'some', 'money', 'to', 'bring', 'that', 'number', 'back', 'to', 'positive', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'hand', 'my', 'account', 'cut', 'off', 'time', 'is', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'et', 'while', 'i', 'am', 'living', 'in', 'california', 'this', 'should', 'be', 'always', 'pacific', 'time', 'a', 'ccording', 'to', 'my', 'residence', 'so', 'whenever', 'i', 'need', 'to', 'protect', 'myself', 'from', 'account', 'overdraft', 'i', 'always', 'have', 'to', 'think', 'of', 'eastern', 'time', 'which', 'is', 'three', 'hrs', 'ahead', 'of', 'pacific', 'time', 'while', 'i', 'am', 'living', 'in', 'california', 'its', 'definitely', 'frustrating']"

0,2,24,77,"Bank of America has started charging our account Overdraft fees on small, one-time debit card transactions just this year, without our opting in. We have had the account since   XX/XX/XXXX , did not  opt-in for overdraft protection, and became alarmed when we were getting hit with stacked, cascading Overdraft charges since the begi nning of  XX/XX/XXXX .      Upon looking into this, we found that this is an illegal practice since   XX/XX/XXXX  - the b ank CAN NOT extend overdraft charges on debit or ATM withdrawals if they did not provide explicit, written explanation of their overdraft program, allow the customer to affirmatively consent to the program, agree to the fees, and then provide documentation of the customers written consent.     We called BOA and requested copies to show any evidence that we opted in, which they were unable to supply. The only documents we were given were a basic account opening document with not even a mention of any Overdraft protection program, let alone the legally required, separate notice outlining the program.     We called again, and were told they could not reverse our charges without our lodging a complaint.     This is very likely happening to many customers, and needs to stop, and all illegally obtained charges need to be reversed.     htt ps : //www.helpwithmybank.gov/get-answers/bank-accounts/overdraft-fees-and-protection/faq-banking-overdraft-13.html","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'started', 'charging', 'our', 'account', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'on', 'small', 'onetime', 'debit', 'card', 'transactions', 'just', 'this', 'year', 'without', 'our', 'opting', 'in', 'we', 'have', 'had', 'the', 'account', 'since', 'xxxxxxxx', 'did', 'not', 'optin', 'for', 'overdraft', 'protection', 'and', 'became', 'alarmed', 'when', 'we', 'were', 'getting', 'hit', 'with', 'stacked', 'cascading', 'overdraft', 'charges', 'since', 'the', 'begi', 'nning', 'of', 'xxxxxxxx', 'upon', 'looking', 'into', 'this', 'we', 'found', 'that', 'this', 'is', 'an', 'illegal', 'practice', 'since', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'b', 'ank', 'can', 'not', 'extend', 'overdraft', 'charges', 'on', 'debit', 'or', 'atm', 'withdrawals', 'if', 'they', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'explicit', 'written', 'explanation', 'of', 'their', 'overdraft', 'program', 'allow', 'the', 'customer', 'to', 'affirmatively', 'consent', 'to', 'the', 'program', 'agree', 'to', 'the', 'fees', 'and', 'then', 'provide', 'documentation', 'of', 'the', 'customers', 'written', 'consent', 'we', 'called', 'boa', 'and', 'requested', 'copies', 'to', 'show', 'any', 'evidence', 'that', 'we', 'opted', 'in', 'which', 'they', 'were', 'unable', 'to', 'supply', 'the', 'only', 'documents', 'we', 'were', 'given', 'were', 'a', 'basic', 'account', 'opening', 'document', 'with', 'not', 'even', 'a', 'mention', 'of', 'any', 'overdraft', 'protection', 'program', 'let', 'alone', 'the', 'legally', 'required', 'separate', 'notice', 'outlining', 'the', 'program', 'we', 'called', 'again', 'and', 'were', 'told', 'they', 'could', 'not', 'reverse', 'our', 'charges', 'without', 'our', 'lodging', 'a', 'complaint', 'this', 'is', 'very', 'likely', 'happening', 'to', 'many', 'customers', 'and', 'needs', 'to', 'stop', 'and', 'all', 'illegally', 'obtained', 'charges', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'reversed', 'htt', 'ps', 'wwwhelpwithmybankgovgetanswersbankaccountsoverdraftfeesandprotectionfaqbankingoverdraft13html']"
1,8,25,80,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017, I went to the local branch of Bank of America in XXXX, NJ, to make a payment on my credit card. I was told to use the Bank of America ATM located there. I inserted the money, {$730.00} in cash, and attempted to make a payment, when the machine came up with an error notice and informed me that my cash would be returned. A few seconds later, another error came up on the screen that said, '' unable to return your money ''. It then printed out a receipt with a contact number for me to call. I went up and spoke to a teller who told me the money would be found that night when the ATM was opened. I then proceeded to call the number listed and was told that there would be a credit within 48 hours to my account for this money. After 48 hours, there was still no credit. We called again and were told it would take seven days. After seven days, I still had not received the money or a credit to my account, so I again called and was informed that I would n't be getting the money back, it was n't their problem, and I was on my own. When I asked about interest fees and my credit report, I was told it was n't their problem. I called the local bank manager, and he gave me another story. He told me that the money would be credited since they found it, and they would take care of any fees associated with it, credit issues, etc. but to give him another few days for it to be done. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from the bank manager, XXXX, again. He told me that everything was taken care of, and the credit would appear on the account within 24 to 48 hours.

The site would not allow me to back out or change my information. I had to turn off my phone to get out of the site. I called my credit card company to make sure there were no charges for this product. They said there were no charges on my account. The web site had no phone numbers or contact information. I forgot about the matter and a week later I received 6 bottles of the product and my credit card was charged {$190.00}. On the statement I received from the Company there was a phone number and a name of the company. I immediately called the phone number to explained what happened and that I did not order the product and wanted to return them. The rep. told me there would be a charge of {$6.00} per bottle and shipping charges. I said that is fraud. I hung up and called my credit card company and explained what happened and wanted to report it as fraud.

I called to return the product. The Company said that they closed my account and I could not return the items, and my account was closed as soon as they were contacted from the credit card company back in  XXXX  regarding fraud. The credit card company does not believe that I did not order the product because all my information was given to them regarding purchasing from the Company. I did not give authorization to use my information and purchase the items. In addition I was not looking to order 6 bottles. I want my money back or a credit on my account. In addition there are numerous negative things being said about the ""  XXXX  '' formula. My daughter told me that it contains Testosterone, not good for women to take. My credit card company will no longer deal with me regarding this matter, they said they used up all the days they can devote to this matter to work on it, and can no longer go any further. The Company closed my account and will not give me any information or contact information on the owners or company information. The original web site is gone. There is no information on the web for the Name of the Company on the statement. I ca n't find any information on the distribution company named on the bottle.

0,2,20,47,"XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX , Texas   XXXX     XXXX   XXXX  , 2017   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   I am an employee of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and a Bank of America customer, checking account numbe  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . My employer also banks with Bank of America, according to our paper checks. I have had direct deposit for years with another bank. However, I contacted my employee earlier in the month of  XXXX  2017, to let them know that I wanted to change my direct deposit to Bank of America. They told me to expect a paper check for the current month.
I received my pay check by mail on   XXXX   XXXX   2017. I took the check to a Bank of America Branch on   XXXX   in  XXXX  to deposit in into my checking account. According to the receipt and the bank teller, I was told that they would hold the funds until  XX/XX/XXXX  the following Wednesday. I could not afford this offer. I was in a crucial financial deficit. I was about to lose my car. The lien holder of my automobile ordered me to pay a certain amount by May 30-no exceptions. I had to comply with them to keep my car. I spoke to the bank manager to no avail. To resolve this problem my option was to reverse the deposit, I had to go to my alternate bank which released the funds of the entire check ( drawn on Bank of America ) the next day.
I had a problem believing that Bank of America was holding my check which is drawn from this bank for so many days. I questioned, why are the funds on hold since it drawn from Bank of America. These funds should be verifiable and released, specifically, since I am a Bank of America customer. I also had an overdraft between {$530.00} {$580.00}. No problem, I was prepared to deposit the check to resolve the overdraft because I was going to have enough to pay my other bills.
In the meantime, n ot anticipating this problem, I made several purchases, scheduled to be processed at Bank of America. These following transactions to  XXXX  Stores - {$250.00} ; {$30.00} {$12.00} ; {$2.00} :   XXXX   - {$120.00} :  XXXX  {$48.00}. I believe all of these merchants are Bank of America customers themselves. The problem is that I figured that Bank of America would at least pay the  XXXX  transactions because they had done so before. I later made a deposit to cover it. Since Bank of America chose not to pay these items referenced above, the merchants continued to submit them, adding the {$35.00} fees per tr ansaction.
I contacted Bank of America and asked them to pay the items because they were Bank of America customers. I was informed that it was an automated decision by the processing center. Yet, the charges kept coming.
I was also concerned ; specifically, relating to the merchants who also acknowledged Bank of America as their bank for business. I contacted a manager on  XX/XX/XXXX to request that {$340.00} in overdraft fees be returned to me. Again, if the bank had paid the items, I would have paid them as the direct deposit was going to be applied. The manager did refund {$100.00}. I was grateful ; however,  the merchants continued to submit the items and Bank of America continued to charge me {$35.00} per transaction.  XX/XX/XXXX , I thought e verything was resolved.  XXXX  made an error and posted {$100.00} to my account. They sent the remaining amount of my paper check by mail. Again, because of financial deficits, I had to return to my alternate bank to cash the check.
The Bank of America system no longer reflects the  XX/XX/XXXX  transaction of the deposit applied and reversed because of an extended hold. It seems that it is my word against them. Because this was done electronically, there has to be a record of this transaction somewhere. When my deposit on  XX/XX/XXXX  was applied, the overdraft totaled, {$820.00}. Although I have small positive balance in my account, this did not have to happen if Bank of America had paid the items presented.
These items have now been returned to the merchants with additional fees. Therefore, I am requesting that Bank of America refund the amount of {$430.00}, which also includes the   XXXX   service fee is {$12.00} since my direct deposit is now in full effect.","BANK OF

If an Item Reappears : All violations of the FCRA are treated seriously and can result in a {$1000.00} fine, payable to you, should you successfully sue the offender and win in court. Sometimes merely notifying a creditor or credit bureau of a violation is enough to get the item removed.
Should an offender refuse to cooperate with you after notification of FCRA violations, and you are not willing or able to go to court, you could report the violation to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and let them pursue the matter. Make sure the offender is aware you are reporting them to one or both of these two agencies. When governmental agencies confront such problems, however, the consumer isnt eligible for the {$1000.00} statutory reward that might otherwise be payable should the matter be resolved in the

The following day he attempt to use his card to buy a drink and it was declined b/c there is still a block on the act. Thursday night I called BOA and they transferred me to several people. I explained what happened and said I have a reciept showing the  XXXX  check +  XXXX  cash. After being on the phone for  3 h rs straight and no one could tell me why the act was closing besides there was a "" cash jam ''. I wanted to know how he received a reciept for a  XXXX  deposit if it jammed, also with BOA. It takes up to 40 bills and only excepts bills it reads and and says what it reads along with having cameras. Still nothing resolved! Friday morning I went to my branch and brought the  two  receipts. After being there for over  2  hours. All they could do is give me the  # s I  have already contacted. They also said they have had several complaints with that particular ATM. and it was weird I have a reciept with the money in question, but they still closed the act. They suggest filling another complaint, so I did. They said come back to the bank on the following We 'd  XXXX  and they will have more info. When I showed up on Wed all the bank manager could do is give me another # to make another complaint, she also said they have sent a cashiers check of  XXXX  on  XXXX . This will be the 3 complaints with the risk dept, ATM service, claims dept. Since then I have been on hold, hung up on collectively of  5+  hrs trying to understand why they wo n't allow him to get the  XXXX  that he deposited and how can he have a reciept with the money that was deposited if it spit it out.

They so many confusing caveats to their website that a customer should get a  one day training just to fully utilize the online resources I called in to speak with two incom petent representatives about the fee. They tried to bait me into an argument by focusing on all the things I could have done. I did not do these things because the options were not made available. I explained to the  Manager   XXXX   th at I have a savings account that should transfer funds when theirs not enough in my checking.  XXXX  said that only applies to ACH transactions, however per the  Core Banking understanding document it states- "" With Overdraft Protection, if you 're about to overdraw your account, we 'll automatically transfer available funds from   your linked savings, credit card or second eligible checking account. On ly 1 tran sfer fee charged per day. I have never had an overdraft fee before and I thought I could trust them, but if I have to deal with employees that are snide and trying to prove a point I can take my business back to  XXXX .  XXXX  makes it know that if it is a transaction about  XXXX  they will charge a fee. Bank of America does not make that fee schedule readily available.

Bank of America closed my account and wo n't let me open another and I ca n't open one with anyone else either. I did n't do anything wrong other than try to get a loan. I contacted the company and they said that it was n't them who I was talking to and dealing with. They said that sometimes internet companies will use other companies names to give out money but there most of the time fraudulent and not the company they say they are. At this point I did n't know what else to do I did call the actual company to complain but because it was n't that company technically they could n't do anything. I also tried to explain to Bank of America that I was unaware of what happened and that I did n't do anything fraudulent but they still close the account and refused to let me open up a new  one  and now because of this I 'm flagged in some sort of banking system and I can open a bank at any Bank and this is so frustrating I need some help please.,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['in', 'xxxx', 'i', 'opened', 'a', 'bank', 'account', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'i', 'was', 'looking', 'for', 'a', 'loan', 'with', 'an', 'internet', 'company', 'that', 'said', 'they', 'could', 'approve', 'me', 'with', 'a', 'loan', 'but', 'they', 'needed', 'to', 'verify', 'my', 'bank', 'and', 'account', 'info', 'they', 'tried', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'deposit', 'in', 'my', 'account', 'but', 'it', 'was', 'something', 'fraudulent', 'with', 'my', 'name', 'on', 'it', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'closed', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'wo', 'nt', 'let', 'me', 'open', 'another', 'and', 'i', 'ca', 'nt', 'open', 'one', 'with', 'anyone', 'else', 'either', 'i', 'did', 'nt', 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'other', 'than', 'try', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'loan', 'i', 'contacted', 'the', 'company', 'and', 'they', 'said', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'nt', 'them', 'who', 'i', 'was', 'talking', 'to', 'and', 'dealing', 'with', 'they', 'said', 'that', 'sometimes', 'internet', 'companies', 'will', 'use', 'other', 'companies', 'names', 'to', 'give', 'out', 'money', 'but', 'there', 'most', 'of', 'the', 'time', 'fraudulent', 'and', 'not', 'the', 'company', 'they', 'say', 'they', 'are', 'at', 'this', 'point', 'i', 'did', 'nt', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'to', 'do', 'i', 'did', 'call', 'the', 'actual', 'company', 'to', 'complain', 'but', 'because', 'it', 'was', 'nt', 'that', 'company', 'technically', 'they', 'could', 'nt', 'do', 'anything', 'i', 'also', 'tried', 'to', 'explain', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'unaware', 'of', 'what', 'happened', 'and', 'that', 'i', 'did', 'nt', 'do', 'anything', 'fraudulent', 'but', 'they', 'still', 'close', 'the', 'account', 'and', 'refused', 'to', 'let', 'me', 'open', 'up', 'a', 'new', 'one', 'and', 'now', 'because', 'of', 'this', 'i', 'm', 'flagged', 'in', 'some', 'sort', 'of', 'banking', 'system', 'and', 'i', 'can', 'open', 'a', 'bank', 'at', 'any', 'bank', 'and', 'this', 'is', 'so', 'frustrating', 'i', 'need', 'some', 'help', 'please']"

0,23,4,28,"I went into Bank Of America on   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 to open a savings account. I spent over 2 hours with a banker who tried to convince me to move over retirement and business banking over to the bank once he found out I was a business owner. I placed {$100.00} in the account and then remembered I had a personal check that had been given to me. I explained to the banker that I make it a habit to never deposit personal checks in my account from non family members and that I had been meaning to stop by Bank of America to cash the check and since I was there opening an account could he have the check cashed and the funds also deposited into my account because the line had 15 people in it. I had already spent so much time with him opening the account. He had me fill out a deposit slip and stated that he 'd take care of it.
He then brought me back the receipt and set up an appointment to follow up with me on  XXXX / XXXX /2017 for other banking products.
I did'nt notice at the time that the check had been deposited into my account and not cashed as I had requested.
The next day I received a call from Bank of America stating that they were closing the Savings account. No reason given and I did inquire as to why and was given the statement that "" there 's nothing wrong we just choose not to do business with you ''. I thought this was strange because I have several accounts at different banks and credit unions all in good standing.
I received a check in the mail from Bank of America a week later for {$88.00}. {$12.00} less than my initial cash deposit because the check had not cleared. So in essence I was penalized for a check that I asked the banker to cash. Then to add insult to injury I find out a month later that I have been put in   XXXX   XXXX   for closure of account due to unpaid charges from Bank of America.
I go back to the local branch of Bank of America on   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 due to   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   notifying me that I 'm in   XXXX   XXXX   and unable to open an account so I can apply for a Private Student Loan for my daughter. I speak to the bank manager who stated it was his first day in the branch and that I would need to call the RIsk Department because he would have no authority to assist me with the issue.
I then call the Risk Department of BOA and they tell me that I 'm not in   XXXX   XXXX   and they 're not sure where that information could be coming from.
So I call   XXXX   XXXX   and they tell me that I am indeed in   XXXX   XXXX    and that I need to dispute the information. I place a dispute and call BOA back. When I call the bank back I am again told that they did n't send anything to   XXXX   XXXX  . I explain that I just got off the phone with   XXXX   XXXX   and they are showing information in their system for unpaid charges. I also explain I have never had a banking relationship with BOA other than the savings account that was open on   XXXX   XXXX   and consequently closed on   XXXX   XXXX  . I have no unpaid charges and there was no valid reason for them to place my name in   XXXX   XXXX  . The representative gets a supervisor they look over the account and she comes back and states that it appears its an error and it will be cleared up within 10 days. She apologizes for the inconvenience assures me it will be taken care of. I also inquired as to whether the check that did n't clear had any bearing on the reason for the account closure and was told there would n't have been any issues if this check had cleared. So I assumed this was a way of telling me without stating the check was the real reason for the account closure.
Then on   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017, I receive a letter dated   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 stating the closure of the account was valid and that they would not be removing me from   XXXX   XXXX  . I have done nothing to warrant my name being placed in   XXXX   XXXX   and need this information removed immediately. If the banker would have followed my instructions the check would have never been placed in the account.
This is causing me harm as I am in the process of getting a private student loan for my daughter and ca n't proceed until this is cleared. I am also trying to secure a new Merchant Account for my business and may not be able to do so due to this information.
I have also reached out to the person who wrote me the check and BOA has done no adverse action against them except for a {$35.00} charge for a returned check.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL

2,5,19,2,"Ladies and Gentlemen : I write because Bank of America 's automated systems reported my automobile loan as being 30 days overdue, when in fact I had submitted a timely payment but inadvertently underpaid as a result of information provided to me by the company 's online payment tool. I phoned the bank 's customer service office but was summarily rebuffed. While I would not object to paying a modest late fee over the miscommunication, the bank 's action has damaged my creditworthiness despite my spotless payment record and good-faith attempt to fulfill my obligations under the loan. The details of the incident : 1. I have maintained an impeccable record of monthly payments on this note since the loan was opened. See Exhibit A ( attached ). It underscores my record of regular payments and highlights an unusual quirk of the Bank of America online payment tool : Our country 's second largest bank maintains an online system that does not allow payments to be scheduled or posted on weekend days.
<P/>
2. Since the loan was issued, I frequently have paid more than the minimum required amount ; that is, made additional principal payments. As you will see from the printouts in Exhibit B, the bank does not merely credit the additional payment against the remaining principal amount, it changes the minimum monthly payment from month to month accordingly.
<P/>
3. Late in   XXXX   of this year, I went online to schedule my payment for  XXXX . On my account page, both the payment due date and payment amount fields indicated "" N/A. '' I assumed that, because I had been paying rather more than the required minimums, and the minimums varied from month to month, that no payment was required for  XXXX . Nevertheless, I scheduled a payment of {$400.00} anyway.
<P/>
4. A month later, when I went online to make my next payment, my account summary indicated a "" late charge '' of {$7.00}, and a total payment due of {$1200.00} ( Exhibit B1 ). I ascribed the late charge to the previous payment 's not having posted until XX/XX/XXXX  and, while a minor annoyance, thought nothing more of it under the circumstances : The previous month, my summary page had indicated "" N/A '' for the amount due, and I had nevertheless submitted a {$400.00} payment. When I drilled down on the website, I saw that my previous month 's payment had posted ( even though it was n't reflected on the account summary page ), and proceeded to schedule the next payment to more than cover the difference between the indicated payment due and the {$400.00} payment that I had made the previous month. Subsequent monthly summaries ( again, see Exhibit B ) showed no late fees of any kind and once again reflected varying minimum payment amounts that were in line with the norm. I never received any unusual notification or indication of a problem of any kind from Bank of America.
<P/>
5. I was appalled when, a few weeks later, my credit monitoring service notified me of "" potentially derogatory information '' having been posted in my files with the  XXXX  major credit reporting agencies. Upon investigation, I discovered that Bank of America had reported my account as being 30 days past due. I called the customer service phone number provided on the bank 's website, and was connected to a spectacularly unhelpful customer service agent.
<P/>
The young woman with whom I spoke informed me that the late charge was not, in fact, a function of of any payment that did n't post prior to the first of the month, but rather that my account was "" delinquent '' because I had not submitted the "" full amount due '' prior to the end of the month of  XXXX . She further advised that the bank 's payment processing systems "" automatically '' report delinquent accounts to the  XXXX  bureaus, informed me that I should have known from my online statements that I had not made the required payment, and that the bank does not offer "" courtesy '' removal of delinquency flags. I pointed out that the statements showed only that a payment had been made, and that the bank 's own website had shown "" N/A '' in the payment due field, yet I had acted in good faith and submitted a payment anyway. I also noted that an inadvertent underpayment, made in good faith and based on information that the bank had given me, is a very, very different thing than being 30 days overdue. I stated that I was not seeking "" courtesy '' redress, but rather correction of automated reporting that would have a material and deleterious impact on my FICO score, as a result of what the bank 's website had led me to conclude. She, in turn, responded that "" there 's no way for our IT department to reconstruct what the site showed on the day you scheduled your payment, '' and therefore I was responsible for the underpayment, and the fact of the total amount actually due was not submitted by the end of the month ( a little over {$100.00}, on a {$25000.00} car loan account with a spotless payment record ) was the same as being 30 days past due. After it became clear that we were talking in circles, I terminated the call.
<P/>
6. I have reported the matter to  XXXX ,  XXXX  and  XXXX , but there are two issue involved here that warrant CFPB 's investigation : a. I am not optimistic that the credit bureaus will look beyond the letter of the law, and it is the essence of a bank 's ability to get away with this sort of behavior that cries out for redress. If it is legal for the bank to behave this way, then I likely will get no relief from the credit monitoring firms.
<P/>
b. This incident speaks to the deliberate ways in which very large financial institutions victimize consumers in order to boost fees and miscellaneous charges ( from which, it is my understanding, these banks reap literally billions of dollars in additional revenue each year ). Specifically, Bank of America 's action did far more than result in my being charged a few extra dollars in fees -- It has had a material and deleterious effect on my credit profile, despite my good faith efforts to fulfill all of may obligations.
<P/>
While the imposition of a late fee is an annoyance, it is n't materially harmful. But in its zeal to harvest such fees, Bank of America acted in bad faith in this case : The bank 's own website provided information that led me to believe that I had no minimum payment due, yet I submitted a timely payment anyway. Had I been informed that there was an underpayment ( beyond merely a statement that showed the amount I already had submitted with no other indication of a problem ), I easily could have made an additional online payment right away ( Here again, we have at issue a pittance -- $ 100-odd, that I easily and happily would have sent as a supplemental payment had I known ).
<P/>
Such an inadvertent underpayment, made in good faith and directly in response to account information shown on the bank 's own website, is a very far cry from being 30 days overdue on a scheduled payment. I am hard pressed to see the reasonableness of the bank 's being able to experience IT failures in its online payment system, then to fail to provide a customer with an appropriate notification ( Every other financial institution with which I work sends an email or text if a payment is not posted by a specific date, yet somehow our country 's second-largest bank does not ), and then to refuse to remove a delinquency flag once the relevant facts have been brought to its attention by a customer with an unblemished payment record.
<P/>
On a macro level, the banks ( including Bank of America ) may be seeking mainly to find ways to generate billions in collective fees and charges. On a micro level, however, the fee is a trivial thing for me compared to the bank 's making it appear to the wider world that I was delinquent or otherwise cavalier regarding the maintenance of my account.
<P/>
By way of redress, I seek no financial adjustment of any kind. I ask only that Bank of America show the same degree of good faith that I have shown throughout the life of this automobile loan, and correct my record with the three leading credit reporting firms. My actions were based on information provided by the bank ; the matter could have been resolved easily within the month of  XXXX  had the bank but notified me ; and the bank representative 's arbitrary and capricious refusal to elevate my complaint to more senior level managers who could have reviewed the facts in evidence smacks of bad faith and a predatory culture on the part of Bank of America. I ask for your assistance in rectifying the situation in accordance with a "" common-man '' standard of reasonableness and good faith.
<P/>

0,2,24,77,"In  XXXX , I had filed a claim in the amount of {$200.00} and was issued a temporary credit of {$200.00}. The claim was recently denied and the {$200.00} was taken back out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX  which caused my account to go negative. I deposited cash into my account to make it a positive balance. Yesterday,  XX/XX/XXXX , the bank withdrew fees of {$100.00} which again made the account go negative and cause another NSF fee of {$35.00} to be withdrawn in addition to the {$100.00}. I had filed a CFPB complaint on  XX/XX/XXXX  in regards to the bank not properly disclosing a change in process regarding fees. The complaint number was  XXXX . These {$100.00} fees from  XXXX  were in relation to that same scenario which previously got corrected by the bank in  XXXX . I contacted the bank this morning and spoke with someone in claims who said they were n't the right department so they transferred me to collections, who of course was n't correct. I called on my lunch and spoke with the general customer service who said they would have to transfer me back to claims. Again, they said they could n't help me. I am asking that these fees be refunded back to me in order to put my account back into the positive status that it was prior to them being taken out. I have been a customer of this bank for 20 years and the level of customer service is horrible now compared to what it used to be.

0,2,20,7,"In   XXXX   of this year (2017) I was the subject of a fraudulent scheme - perpetuated through  XXXX .  I needed a short term apartment rental in   XXXX   XXXX  , CA (for work) and I found one through   XXXX  .  I communicated with the supposed agent and signed a lease.  I transferred $ XXXX  from my Bank of America account to another BoA account provided by the fraudulent agent.

An hour after the transfer, when I had not heard back from the Real Estate Agent, I contacted Bank of America and asked them to stop the wire transfer.  Two things happened while on that call:

1. They confirmed that the wire transfer had NOT yet concluded but refused to stop it fro going through.

2. The BoA agent - His name was  XXXX  I think (in their fraud team) told me ""Sir I am sorry - but it looks like you have been the subject of a fraud.  When I asked him how he could be sure, he said ""We've had other bank customers complain in the past that they transferred money into this same account and did not receive the service for which they were paying"".  

In other words; Bank of America knew or at least had knowledge of previous fraudulent activity on the account but still did not warn me (a 20 year customer with BoA) in advance of the transfer.  The bank simply allowed me to throw my good money into what they knew was a suspect account.

I contacted the bank on several occasions about this.  I even asked to file an Enterprise Complaint , but they basically told me that the error was mine and they closed my inquiry / compliant with ""Customer Error"".

I acknowledge that I initiated the wire transfer.  But my bank of 20 years did nothing to warn me that I was transferring money into a suspect account.  And then, when I opened an inquiry - they placated me on the phone with a bunch of ""I am so Sorry"" statements and promptly closed the complaint and assigned the fault to me.


Here are some additional details:

Total amount $  XXXX   Recipient Name:    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  
Recipient Account #:    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX

Here is a summary of the compliant I filed with the FBI:

Description of Incident Provide a description of the incident and how you were victimized. Provide information not captured elsewhere in this complaint form.

My plans required travel to   XXXX   XXXX  , CA for work. I was looking for a long term rental unit. I found this link through   XXXX   XXXX   I communicated with the person who had the listing. He called himself   XXXX   XXXX    (  XXXX   XXXX   . I have a record of all communication. I provided dates and agreed to the price. I transferred $ XXXX  from my Bank of America account to an account he provided. One hour after the transfer, when I had not heard from him, I became suspicious and called my bank to report a claim. I was told by the bank that the recipient's account had been subject of previous similar complaints. Now I knew this was a fraud. I contacted the person who had listed the property and asked to cancel the reservation. He wrote back and said, OK .. but I need your Drivers License to start the cancellation process. At this point I was not going to provide any additional information and did NOT give him my license information. He assured me there was no fraud and asked me to stop being concerned. Of course when I arrived in   XXXX   XXXX   I could not contact him. I went to the property and the office knew of no such arrangement. Please note: There are two names here:   XXXX   XXXX   - Is the person I communicated with. he referred to himself as an independent agent. He gave me a phone number ( XXXX )  XXXX  The other person -   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX . I don't not speak with this person.

If your offices fail to respond with clarity to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. This also includes not contracting with other credit reporting companies or debt collectors using means of extortion in attempt to collect something that was never due. There is also the matter of information breach which   XXXX   puts me at risk currently, It would be advisable that you and your client assure that your records are in order before I am forced to take legal action.

This is a request for validation made pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Memorandum in support A misrepresentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the truth. When a person enters a contract because of his justifiable reliance on a misrepresentation about some important fact, the contract is voidable.
Misrepresentations can be either : 1. innocent ( not intentionally deceptive ) or 2.
fraudulent ( made with the knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive ). Contracts induced by misrepresentation or fraud are generally considered voidable. This means that the person whose consent was not real has the power to rescind ( cancel ) the contract. The elements of misrepresentation and fraud are as follows - notice the similarities. ( authors addition ) Innocent misrepresentation Fraud 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2.
Assertion relates to material fact 3. Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 1. Untrue assertion of fact ( or equivalent ) 2. Assertion made with knowledge of falsity and intent to deceive 3.
Actual reliance 4. Justifiable reliance 5. Economic loss ( in a tort action for damages PARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the whole truth, about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance.
The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds consensus ad idem, occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman.
A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are notof the same and equal kind. 7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint.
Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

1,8,30,22,"Thank you in advance for your time and help. This is in regards to a credit card with Bank of America, XXXX, Wa. and in the past XXXX, Wa. XXXX XXXX, Bank of America where I used to live. When I opened the new Bank of America account in XXXX, Wa. ( XXXX ) they gave me a new credit and debit card. I have never in my life taken cash advances off a credit card and never made late payments. Normally I just write out a payment for my credit card, check the few things charged and mail the payment. This last payment ( XXXX ) I noticed that my balance was incredibly higher and was getting higher and higher. I happened to look to the bottom of the page of the bill this time and noticed that they were calling out "" Interest for cash advances '' and at 19!!!! percent. I only charge a few things a month from my home online - Never even take my credit card nor use it in the outside world, just inside my home. After pulling out all of my records going back 10 years ( and I have more than that going back ) I see that this is in the thousands of dollars and they show right now that I have got "" cash advances '' of approximately {$12000.00} dollars. I have never got "" cash advances '' When I send in a payment for say {$300.00} only {$100.00} goes on to pay off the card balance, because they are charging ( with the "" cash advances '' at 19 percent ) {$200.00} that the bank KEEPS. Again, I never get cash advances off of my credit card, nor did I know I was even allowed so much for "" cash advances '' ... ... .I never noticed that before now because I did n't get "" cash advances '' A card that I had never used or activated a number of years ago was frauded and the bank told me that they would credit my account for it as long as I called the Police ( XXXX Police Department , XXXX , Wa . which I did ... ... .I believe the date of this was XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and was for more than {$1000.00} frauded off of a card I had never activated ... .In the letter the bank put account number ending in XXXX. Another was for XX/XX/XXXX for ATM fraud account # XXXX for I believe {$400.00}, Another for XX/XX/XXXX for {$150.00}. "" XXXX XXXX '' "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I have not idea means ... ..maybe frauded, Acct XXXX,. Another {$400.00}. acct XXXX Acct #, XX/XX/XXXX. I also have paperwork from the bank which I have no idea it means regarding a {$2000.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX "" LST  CREDIT TRANSFER '' and I have not idea what this means or stands for ... ... appears to be for an ERROR the bank because they credit my account # XXXX and the "" New Balance Total '' is "" {$0.00} Again, this is for the paperwork done on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had noticed some other errors such as someone ( not me ) reported that there was a {$.00} error on interest at a nother spot. The first time I called the bank regarding ALL of this, I was passed around to 6 people over a 2-1/2 hours period of time and the first 4 at least said they do not keep records going back this far ... ... I mentioned income tax stuff beause THAT is WHY I had ALL of my records going back forever. I called again recently last week and talked to a "" XXXX '' XX/XX/XXXX, his number XXXX ... ..He kept looking through whatever and said he would send me copies showing the "" cash advances '' and I said there should be a record with the bank of WHOEVER made these because it was n't me - like a photograph of the person or persons ... ... He sent the banks records shortly thereafter and they are they exact Same records I have with NOTHING showing WHO did the "" cash advances '' I also told him that in XXXX I had "" Overdraft Protection '' and was told I would be charged {$10.00} or {$12.00} per overdraft ... ..I rarely have overdrafted my account and would NEVER had overdrafted it for {$400.00} ... ... .So it is hard to understand how I have such a huge balance with huges numbers of $ $ $ added EVERY month for "" cash advances '' ... ... .I noticed that sometime I think going back to XX/XX/XXXX, interest that was charged on balance was hardly anything compared to be charged {$200.00}. a month now ... ..Any help you give me is much appreciated","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['thank', 'you', 'in', 'advance',

0,2,20,54,"I called Bank of America regarding a return item fee on my account. I explained that the cutoff on the ATM machines state the business day is over at XXXX XXXX local time and I thought that was across the board but the app has different information and list it as XXXX XXXX ET. I spoke to XXXX # XXXX, a supervisor who basically informed me that is was my error and it was just MY account that was not eligible for courtesy waiver even though my account has never had the issue before. I asked per policy and procedure shouldnt all accounts be treated the same? She said yes per fed regulations they had to but MY account was not getting a courtesy waiver. She basically said depending on the account, Bank of America can or can not make the decision to waive the fee. I have had a similar issue with Bank of America in the past. What criteria do they use to determine when fee waivers occur if the customer is at fault? What makes my call to BOA for courtesy waiver different than another customer who calls in and misses the deposit cutoff time and request a waiver? I would like that information from BOA as well as the {$35.00} fee waived if it can not be provided, because all customers are not being treated equal. What is the basis of the unequal treatment is it gender, race, religion, geographic location? I would understand if there was a policy in place and no one received it, but to just say no when I have never asked or had this issue before is ridiculous without a reasonable explanation when it is something that is offered to some customers. They need to provide data showing the race/gender of customers that are offered fee waivers. Would that data be skewed? Does it favor particular groups?","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'called', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'regarding', 'a', 'return', 'item', 'fee', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'i', 'explained', 'that', 'the', 'cutoff', 'on', 'the', 'atm', 'machines', 'state', 'the', 'business', 'day', 'is', 'over', 'at', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'local', 'time', 'and', 'i', 'thought', 'that', 'was', 'across', 'the', 'board', 'but', 'the', 'app', 'has', 'different', 'information', 'and', 'list', 'it', 'as', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'et', 'i', 'spoke', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'a', 'supervisor', 'who', 'basically', 'informed', 'me', 'that', 'is', 'was', 'my', 'error', 'and', 'it', 'was', 'just', 'my', 'account', 'that', 'was', 'not', 'eligible', 'for', 'courtesy', 'waiver', 'even', 'though', 'my', 'account', 'has', 'never', 'had', 'the', 'issue', 'before', 'i', 'asked', 'per', 'policy', 'and', 'procedure', 'shouldnt', 'all', 'accounts', 'be', 'treated', 'the', 'same', 'she', 'said', 'yes', 'per', 'fed', 'regulations', 'they', 'had', 'to', 'but', 'my', 'account', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'a', 'courtesy', 'waiver', 'she', 'basically', 'said', 'depending', 'on', 'the', 'account', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'can', 'or', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'the', 'decision', 'to', 'waive', 'the', 'fee', 'i', 'have', 'had', 'a', 'similar', 'issue', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'what', 'criteria', 'do', 'they', 'use', 'to', 'determine', 'when', 'fee', 'waivers', 'occur', 'if', 'the', 'customer', 'is', 'at', 'fault', 'what', 'makes', 'my', 'call', 'to', 'boa', 'for', 'courtesy', 'waiver', 'different', 'than', 'another', 'customer', 'who', 'calls', 'in', 'and', 'misses', 'the', 'deposit', 'cutoff', 'time', 'and', 'request', 'a', 'waiver', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'that', 'information', 'from', 'boa', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'fee', 'waived', 'if', 'it', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'provided', 'because', 'all', 'customers', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'treated', 'equal', 'what', 'is', 'the', 'basis', 'of', 'the', 'unequal', 'treatment', 'is', 'it', 'gender', 'race', 'religion', 'geographic', 'location', 'i', 'would', 'understand', 'if', 'there', 'was', 'a', 'policy', 'in', 'place', 'and', 'no', 'one', 'received', 'it', 'but', 'to', 'just', 'say', 'no', 'when', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'asked', 'or', 'had', 'this', 'issue', 'before', 'is', 'ridiculous', 'without', 'a', 'reasonable', 'explanation', 'when', 'it', 'is', 'something', 'that', 'is', 'offered', 'to', 'some', 'customers', 'they', 'need', 'to', 'provide', 'data', 'showing', 'the', 'racegender', 'of', 'customers', 'that', 'are', 'offered', 'fee', 'waivers', 'would', 'that', 'data', 'be', 'skewed', 'does', 'it', 'favor', 'particular', 'groups']"
0,2,22,109,"On XXXX XXXX 2017, I opened a business account with Bank of America. Initially, everything was going fine. They sent me a welcome email on XXXX XXXX 2017 and they let me know that my business debit card was coming in the mail. On XXXX XXXX 2017, I tried to activate my new business debit card and it said the card could not be found. I spoke with a customer service representative and they told me that my account was closed. I asked why it was closed and all she would say is that "" it was a business decision. '' I asked to speak to her superior and she told me that I could but they would tell me the same thing. When I spoke to her superior, I was told again that my account was closed and she did n't have to give me a reason why the account was closed but it was on page 2 of my contract stating that they could close the account at any time. I told her I 've never received any contract and I could not find any information stating this information. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on the same day. On XXXX XXXX 2017, I received a call from XXXX XXXX and he stated he was with the Complaints Department with Bank of America and he received my complaint from the Better Business Bureau and he wanted to know what happened. I told him what happened but something about this guy did n't sound right with me. He told me that he would look into the matter and get back to me as to why the account was closed. What I could n't understand was he was able to pull up my information in his computer yet he could n't see why the account was closed? I grew more suspicious of XXXX XXXX and thought this guy is going to come up with some sort of lie as to why the account was closed which to this day, there 's no reason for at all. The next day, I received a packet in the mail from Bank of America welcoming me to their bank and issued my bank account number. I called XXXX XXXX and told him that the customer service representative on the phone expressed to me that I would not be receiving this packet in the mail because the account was closed, yet I received it. All this guy could tell me was it was already sent off and they can not control when the packet would arrive at my house but he would get back to me no later than XXXX XXXX 2017 which he said was on a Monday. When I looked at the calendar, it falls on a Saturday. These people are going around the world and back to come up with a lie as to why they closed the account and no one ever gave me an honest answer.

The manager at that branch said that the temporary adjustments were n't there to withdraw. I said I did n't make those claims and did n't care about them cause they were deposits that i used my debit card on. Not credit!!!! Until she pointed out the one about my ticket that i did n't notice. Money was n't available for withdraw or to spend. When she got tired of me telling her how can I use my debit card on something that is n't there. She said I ca n't help you!! I got told why would I spend some one else 's money that was n't mine as I was leaveing.

2,5,19,63,"In these years, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, 3 credit card accounts were documented by the Bank of America, as having been opened by me. Before I knew about Identify theft, I tried to fix these debited cards and amounts by making payments. I was never able to pay them off as the interest and fees were accruing faster than I could pay. Some months I paid {$500.00} or {$700.00} towards the balance. The balances got up into the thousands of dollars, not because I used them, authorized the card or owed the money, but because of fees and interest. When I found out about identify theft, I sought to work something out with the bank. They denied my effort and made no remarks about the IT. I tried several times to report, to the bank and the credit reporting companies, when I had the name and information of the person who opened and used my information. One of the indictors was an address in XXXX XXXX, as being listed as mine. I never lived in XXXX XXXX, and with this new information, I was able to provide proof that I did not open, and I never lived in XXXX XXXX. Recently, I was able to get XXXX to agree to Identity theft, and XXXX XXXX and XXXX. However, they would not take the debt off. The Bank of America wrote off, discharged, the debts, totaling over {$20.00} and gave no reason. They sent me and the IRS a Tax Statement document so stating dated tax year XX/XX/XXXX. <P/>Here is the problem I need help with : The debts were discharged, and total amounts provided to the IRS. However the Bank of America, continues to send to the 3 credit reporting companies, all 3 debts as still open, ongoing and continuing to accrue at thousands of dollars. They wrote it off, but continue to leave it on my report as an open and accumulating debt. This reporting by Bank of America continues to ruin my credit, and appears that the debts and cards are still active. <P/>I had a credit card with XXXX, and it was for {$900.00}. When XXXX saw the above issues on my credit report, they lowered my credit to {$250.00}. I am in XXXX XXXX, and use the XXXX card for my books and supplies. XXXX said they will restore my credit card to {$900.00} if I can prove that what is showing on those 3 reports is an error. I have tried to get the 3 companies to look at the charge off documents and told of the IT and gave them all of the particulars, as stated here.

1,8,25,80,"Problem : Bank of America ( BOA ) accessed my account without my authorization via a system override to create a pay to account to pay themselves. I noticed this when I received an Email stating : "" a pay to account has been set up for account xxxx ... If you did not create this pay to account please contact us. '' I do not use the bill pay system at BOA to pay my credit card. I pay my credit card balance in full ever month ( sometimes twice ). I use the balance transfer process to pay my balance for this credit card. I felt violated that BOA misused my financial information for their benefit - without my authorization. When I contacted BOA to get it addressed I was told that "" I created the pay to account. '' To which I advised that I did not, and requested that the representative check the records to validate payment process used to pay the card every month. I further noted that I did receive an Email from BOA to contact them in the event that I did not create this pay to account - and was following the guidance of the Email by contacting them and making them aware of the problem. I requested a supervisor and was given the XXXX XXXX in the XXXX PA office, who agreed - this was a misuse of my financial information for their benefit, and should not have occurred without my authorization. She then warm transferred me to a Online Banking representative ( XXXX, Lastname unknown ) who advised that a "" system override '' was used by BOA to authorize them to access my account to create this pay to account on my behalf - confirming this was not done by me - the customer but by BOA. I feel like BOA has taken advantage of my trust in creating a direct route to access my financial resources to pay themselves. The account has never been past due and I have always paid my balance on time and in full. Customers should be aware that this is happening. If they can access your account to set a payment account for themselves, whats to stop them from creating a system override to filter money from your account. This is wrong, it is an unauthorized misuse of my information. They should not have the right to go into my account to make this change. This leads me to believe that my account information is not protected from BOA employees. For the purposes of this complaint the manager in XXXX PA and the online banking representative was very helpful. Please redact their names for publishing purposes so they are not retaliated against by BOA. Their names were provided to benefit the investigation. I did ask for a policy, procedure or other documentation where BOA has notified customers that they can make this type of change, and was advised there was no such documentation. I also asked for a customer inquiry, reference, or other tracking number to document the call today, and was advised that there was no such reference number.

2,5,19,2,"I received a letter from Bank of America in regards to my credit card on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. They indicated that I had failed to pay my bill and that they closed another card I had with them ( had that card since XXXX ) and that the card in question had been delinquent over 60 days and that they had contacted the credit bureaus. I immediately called BOA and explained to them that I never received a bill or statement. They told me what email they had sent the bill to and that email address was outdated and no longer in commission. This means they would have received an error message when emailing that address. I realize this is likely an automated process and that maybe they do n't have a process for checking for outdated email kickbacks. But when an account goes delinquent that has been in good standing for over 10 years with no late payments - One would think that they would reach out to the customer in another way. BOA had an alternate email address on file - never used it. They had my phone number on file - never called me. They had my address on file - never sent a statement or a letter ( until the one informing me they contacted the credit bureau ). I never received a statement and therefore did not know I owed anything. I rarely use this particular credit card. My history will show my balance was XXXX with activity in XXXX and XXXX - soley because I had my XXXX stolen and was waiting for a new one. I thought I had paid off the balance in XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) but one more charge came through. This charge was {$110.00} and that is the charge that went past due. I paid off the balance of this mess ( {$170.00} after late fees ) the day I received the letter from BOA ( XX/XX/XXXX ). My credit score dropped XXXX points because of this incident. In XXXX XXXX my credit score was XXXX and this one late payment resulted in my credit score dropping to XXXX. I have filed a dispute with Bank of America who continually promise the matter will be resolved but it never is. It has been almost 3 months now. I filed a dispute with XXXX who sent me a letter indicating that nothing could be done. I have now filed a dispute with XXXX. Two issues exist here. # 1 I never received a bill and they knew that - because the email address would have failed. They never used any other available means of contact and therefore BOA was fully aware that I never received a bill and still proceeded to file a derogatory claim against me with the credit bureau. That is just wrong. # 2 The punishment does not match the crime. I 'm XXXX years old and have had credit since my father co-signed my first car loan when I was XXXX years old. I 've had a credit card since I was XXXX ( and still have that card today ). Never once in XXXX years have I ever had a late payment or any other kind of derogatory claim against me. And yet because of one late payment my credit score drops XXXX points? From Excellent to Good?? This does not add up to me. And that is an issue with the Credit Reporting Agencies. The whole point of a credit score is to indicate your credit worthiness to creditors. Now it looks as though I have a shotty payment history when in fact that is not true. Quite the opposite. This is negatively affecting my life as we are looking to buy a new home and will be forced to pay a higher interest rate should this matter not be resolved. Over 30 years that will equal tens of thousands of dollars. All because Bank of America never thought to utilize the alternative forms of contact available to them to send me a bill for {$110.00}. And because apparently to the credit bureau - that 's a crime worth a lifetime of credit built. This is just not adding up to me. It feels wrong. This is my last resort. I truly appreciate your time.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'received', 'a', 'letter', 'from', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'in', 'regards', 'to', 'my', 'credit', 'card', 'on', 'xxxx',

I have called every day and am always given some excuse - I had to wait three business days before they could register a claim, that it can then take an additional 5-10 business days for the refund, the Patriot Act ( this was from XXXX in the West Virginia call center today and I asked him that it takes two weeks due to the Patriot Act? No response ). I have been told three times that I should expect to receive the refund Saturday or today. Nope, nothing as yet. It is interesting that a bank will take your money in a matter of seconds but can not explain why it takes two weeks to return an error. XXXX told me the refund was approved today!!!!!!!!!!

1,9,29,20,"I was layed off from my job, applied for NJ unemployment and was given a debit card. One week it was loaded with XXXX $ and the next day it was XXXX. There were 5 charges from 500 miles away apparently done online that accumulated my entire check. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX All Done on the same date. I disputed charges and recieved provisional credit, then the money was deducted out of my account after the investigation. They found that the charges were correct. I dealt with some of the rudest people I have ever talked to in my life, there were no similar transactions or any background to lead them to believe I was not in fact telling the truth. They gave me transaction numbers, company numbers to contact, told me if I found any information that it would help my case. I spoke with supervisors, documented at XXXX XXXX, their sister company XXXX XXXX and not only did they agree with me that these charges are bogus, they could not find any of the transaction numbers to be valid, they could not find in archive me ever having, creating or supplying my card to an account or anybody affiliated with any of the above. They shared similar stories, were helpful in my concern and ideas and recommendations how to proceed. I have not been able to get in contact or recieve a return phone call recently from XXXX XXXX XXXX but i spoke with someone originally when this happened and they also could not verify a single thing. XXXX XXXX  is no longer in business or the phone number BOA gave me is no longer valid. How in any way possible BOA verified any of these charges blows my mind, they are in no way, no how possible or valid, I have since run out of unemployment, still aggressively surching the job market, married with mortgage and XXXX children at home and that 700 plus dollars means the world to me. I have been questioned ten times over was the card in my possession, could someone else in your household of used it, etc .... to the point of borderline disrespect. This now has been my second dismissal where they verified the charges. I called on X/XX/2017 at XXXX and spoke with charge companies and BOA for about an hour. They suggested re opening my claim and I did the research, called to verify my information that was gathered today at approx XXXX and amazingly they reopened, investigated and verified the claims and closed my claim again by the time I even called. I tell you what, they have a window of 90 days they said to expect a result yet they contacted the same companies that I talked to Friday that can not locate validation anywhere, they emailed, faxed or exchanged documents over the weekend about my so called charges and gathered and decided all to be valid by Monday. They must of opened the claims dept over the weekend, all 6 parties included etc ... I would not take it out of context to say BOA is playing the laws of average that if they deny X amount of claims, only a certain percentage wiill invest the time and money to fight there bogus findings. Its not my fault they are rated one of the worst for situations like this and I want my money and a apology.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'was', 'layed', 'off', 'from', 'my', 'job',

We had never received this payment and I had not actively banked with Bank of America in over 10 years.

Bank of America never attempted to call me or contact me, even though my cell phone has remained unchanged for 15 years. They simply documented internally that they were unable to locate an address. <P/>Bank of America then proceeded to file a XXXX form saying they had paid me {$3100.00} and filed it with the IRS, even though they had received the check back. <P/>After my inquiry, Bank of America promptly reissued a check for the amount of {$4100.00}. This was sen out on XX/XX/XXXX and I cashed it on XX/XX/XXXX <P/>No one in the branch or from the Corporate office was ever able to explain the discrepancy between the check issued for {$4100.00} and the XXXX form stating the amount of {$3100.00}. <P/>This information is affirmed by a letter Bank of America sent me, dated XX/XX/XXXX <P/>The problem is that the IRS states that to avoid paying late fees on this amount, Bank of America needs to reissue a XXXX form.

If Bank of America refuses to reissue a new XXXX form I will be forced to pay late fees to the IRS on money I never received. <P/>This seems to be related to illegal activity undertaken by Bank of America while I was a XXXX veteran and if this is not resolved soon I will be contacting local media to see if anyone would like to pick up the story.

A transaction named "" CREDIT BALANCE REFUND DEBIT '' was posted on XX/XX/2016. I have no idea of what it is. I never requested for the refund ; I did not see where the refund went either. <P/>( 2 ) XXXX The customer service gave me wrong information about my autopay setup and it prevents me from calculating and meeting the spending request of the welcome offer. I was confirmed a few times by the customer service that I had set up autopay successfully. However, I have been charged late fee and interests multiple times after that. Though they agreed to waive those fees, the inconsistency confused me with the calculation of my spending amount in the given period specified by the welcome offer. I calculated using the payment amount with the assumption that the payment amount should equal to the spending amount ( as the customer representative told me that autopay 's been set up correctly. However, there is discrepancy between them for either the wrong info provided by the customer service or issues with BofA autopay system and hence the spending amount was calculated wrongly ( I missed by ~ {$20.00} ). After finding out this issue, I immediately filled up the difference by spending another {$40.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and tried to contacted BofA.

0,2,28,106,"Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX XXXX, I received a text message from Bank of America to verify a business checking debit card transaction from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX XXXX ) in the amount of {$8900.00} which was already approved by their bank/Visa department. I immediately responded via a text message that I did not authorize that transaction, and then telephoned Bank of America. I verbally informed them that I did not make a purchase, as I was at work at the time. Therefore, the Bank of America business debit card was canceled at that time and I submitted a fraud claim over the phone with the fraud department. I was informed that it would take up to 2 weeks before the charge would be reversed. I told them that was no acceptable to me, because that transaction created a negative balance in my checking account. In addition, I have been a customer with Bank of America for over 30 years personally and for 20 years with my business accounts. Based on my history, special consideration should be implemented. But again, I was told that it would take up to 2 weeks and that they were sorry for the inconvenience. Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, I telephoned Bank of America requesting {$8900.00} be returned to my account. I was informed that since the transaction was still processing, that they could deposit the funds into my business account, and they did that immediately. Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, the transaction from XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$8900.00} posted to my business checking account which created a negative balance, and thus overdraft charges. Once again, I notified the Bank of America frauddepartment requesting the charge be reversed because I have a business to run. However, they said that they were sorry and told me that there was nothing that could be done until the investigation was completed. I voiced much frustration and deep dissatisfaction in the handling of this situation. Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, I telephoned the Bank of America frauddepartment because of returned payments along with an increasing negative balance in my business checking account. I requested that they pay the pending recurring transactions because I could not cancel them due to the timing of this event. My business partner, XXXX XXXX, and I were on the phone with the customer representative, XXXX, from the fraud department. She said she could escalate the claim to be reviewed in 48 to 72 hours as a hardship case to reverse the charges sooner than the 2-week timeframe. We both voiced that was still not acceptable and stated that we wanted to file a complaint, which she stated that she filed on our behalf. Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, I telephoned XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX, the assistant manager and informed her of this fraudulent activity. She indicated that she would file a fraud report and notify the corporate office accordingly. Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, I spoke with the manager, XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX inquiring as to whether their corporate fraud department was contacted by Bank of America. I was told that no contact was made. Once again, I contacted the Bank of America fraud department to check on the status of the escalation and was told that it was still processing. Again, I voiced my dissatisfaction with the handling of my claim as to why no one has contacted XXXX XXXX yet! At that point, I was livid and informed Bank of America I will obtain legal representation to deal with this matter. Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2017, I spoke with XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. She informed me that a man presented my Visa business credit card with his name on it and purchased a love seat, sofa and dining room set. XXXX also stated that the transaction occurred at XXXX XXXX on X/XX/17, and all cashier transactions are videotaped. Also, XXXX mentioned that the corporate fraud department was waiting on Bank of America to contact them. XXXX also advised me to file a police report, which I did the same day. I telephoned the Bank of America fraud department and gave them the information given to me from XXXX. I inquired why they still havent contacted XXXX XXXX. I was again told that my claim was still processing despite the escalation, which was to be within 48 to 72 hours. Therefore, I went into a Bank of America branch with the hope of getting some help with this situation, but to no avail. However, the customer service representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX refunded the overdraft charges to my business checking account. XXXX XXXX was puzzled as to why Visa authorized such a large debit authorization, especially when I have never made a debit transaction of this magnitude in the 20 years that Ive been a business customer with Bank of America. While at the bank, I explained to XXXX XXXX that I have my lease payment of {$2900.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. As a last resort, I attempted to withdraw the said amount from my personal Bank of America Visa card. However, I was declined authorization by Visa and another Bank of America customer service representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX called Visa to ask why I was denied. She, too, was shocked as to why Visa approved such a large transaction but then denied me for an increase for a cash withdrawal level on my personal credit card. I explained to the Visa customer representative why I needed the cash. I also stated that Visa created this fiasco by failing to notify me before authorizing a large transaction. But that did not seem to matter to them and was transferred to the Bank of America fraud department, which again was not helpful at all. I was told that the claim was still processing. Therefore, I voiced my frustration and contempt for the disgraceful way in which this claim has been handled by a loyal customer for over 30 years. According to the Total Security Protection Package, the fraudulent charge should have been returned to the account within 24 hours. The Bank of America and Visa Security System totally failed to protect my account, illegally encumbered my money, and has caused unnecessary stress and harm to the financial well-being of my business.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['wednesday', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'at', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'i', 'received', 'a', 'text', 'message', 'from', 'bank', 'of',

<P/>
Their ad mentioned that I could cancel this order within 14 days after I received it and tried it. This is an online order but they didnt provide any way to cancel this order online and could only cancel via telephone. It took over 30 minutes to talk to their customer representative.
<P/>
After the cancellation, one month later I found that there were two charges, in the amount of {$97.00} & {$98.00} on my Bank of America credit card bill. I called them again to protest the said two charges but their representative informed me that my account had already been cancelled and refused to provide a return authorization and return address.
<P/>
So, I claimed the dispute of charges and called Bank of America to stop the charges because the items were not the same as the online ad. Also, I had already cancelled my future shipment within 14 days after the first shipment. They also didnt provide any terms and conditions when ordering the items nor in the shipment and no information on how to return the merchandise and receive a return authorization and did not provide a return address.
<P/>
Bank of America promised to investigate this issue, but Bank of America failed and refused to resolve this issue and charged {$97.00} & {$98.00} without investigation.

Please take care of this dispute and get a refund for {$97.00} & XXXX. I look forward to a quick action.

3,4,11,5,"I, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( DOB : XX/XX/XXXX debt collector for credit card that I contend was erroneously sent to collections, as I had established auto payment ( {$50.00} ) above initial minimum payment ( approx. {$35.00} ) for a Bank of America credit card opened onXX/XX/XXXXwith {$2500.00} credit limit. The ( a ) initial billing and ( b ) date auto payment was established are conveniently not included in discovery, and I am unable to obtain this information online through my current BOA checking account. I have not contacted BOA since the filing of this lawsuit due to distrust and not knowing source of presumed fraudulent practices. BOA contacted me about delinquency of account, but on at least two occasions before account was transferred to collections, I spoke to BOA rep, which could not explain why the auto payments, in excess of billing expenses, were not adequate. In XX/XX/XXXX when balance was approximately {$1800.00}, below the {$2500.00} limit, I had transaction declined at local XXXX and then learned that BOA suspended the card. On XX/XX/XXXX BOA sold account to XXXX XXXX XXXX for undocumented amount. I am being sued for {$3800.00}. Though I have had no direct dealings with XXXX XXXX XXXX court record notes, "" The last payment was posted to the account on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$50.00}. '' In reality, BOA continued to take auto payments for 47 months after it was sent to collections through XX/XX/XXXX, and without any expressed agreement and/or without addressing my contentions that the auto payments were timely and adequate, BOA sent this money to collections agent.

0,2,28,106,"In XX/XX/XXXX I paid XXXX XXXX for a copy of XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was given a download link and registration number for the software, which I downloaded from XXXX  and registered. I then used the software for the next 10 months until XXXX notified me that the software purchased was not authentic. During this period the software vendor appears to have closed their business, so my attempts to contact the software vendor were futile. ( email attached ) XXXX assigned a case number ( # XXXX ) and sent me a letter stating that the software was not authentic. I then went to my bank ( Bank of America ) and because the debit card used was a Visa debit card, they investigated the case notifying me that I was within the deadline and issued a temporary credit on XX/XX/XXXX for {$910.00}. ( docs attached ) As of XX/XX/XXXX, the temporary credit has been withdrawn because the bank of XXXX XXXX stated that they were not notified within 60 days of the initial transaction per a notification letter from Bank of America. ( doc attached ) I would point out that : 1. ) I was not notified by XXXX that the software I downloaded from their site and registered through their site was not authentic until 10 months after the initial download and registration. This untimely notification unduly inhibits me as the purchaser from taking timely action against the software vendor.
<P/>
2. ) Because the vendor is no longer in business ( I presume ) I cant get their side of the story regarding the sale. It was suggested by yet another vendor that XXXX may have purchased a large site license from XXXX and then decided to sell off individual licenses. This may be what happened, but I ca n't confirm not can I comment on the legality of this practice.

I would like to know what recourse, if any, I as a small business owner have in this regard. I have lost critical funding and although primary responsibility would naturally sit with the vendor who illegally sold the software they ca n't represent themselves.

In XXXX XXXX, a woman named XXXX XXXX signed up for our XXXX training program which spans the course of one year. Our XXXX training program is {$6000.00} and we have all of our trainees sign a contract which states that there are no refunds given under any circumstances. XXXX XXXX purchased a home in XXXX in XXXX XXXX. She requested a refund in XXXX because she was concerned about her new commute and realized it would require additional travel time. XXXX XXXX filed a chargeback dispute. I, on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, responded to the dispute by sending XXXX XXXX 's contract and receipt as proof of her participation in our program. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX denied my dispute because evidently there was not enough documentation to support the dispute. I then filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Board with XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX responded in favor to my dispute on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the {$6000.00} was returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. PLEASE NOTE : I am submitting the response letter from XXXX XXXX. Today, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX which explained that XXXX XXXX filed a second chargeback dispute. I was not aware of this. The letter explained that I did not respond to the initial retrieval request and that my chargeback representment rights do not exist. I called XXXX XXXX  immediately to explain that I DID NOT receive the second dispute notification in the mail and XXXX XXXX explained to me that there was nothing more that could be done on my behalf. This is why I am filing a complaint with the CFPB once again. Please note : The information listed below is from my first complaint that I filed with XXXX XXXX which was then granted in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 's favor. I implore you to please reconsider your decision based on the information and documentation I have provided below. In addition : I also explained to XXXX XXXX that I do not receive mail to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  because our facility was vandalized. We were not receiving mail and then decided to obtain a XXXX. XXXX  All mail on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, should be mailed to the following address immediately. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX This may be why I did not receive the request to send further documentation for the second reversal chargeback. The only reason I received this new documentation from XXXX XXXX was because it was forwarded to our XXXX XXXX XXXX I just received it today on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It was dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was given our XXXX training manual which was installed on her XXXX by a technician. Please note : I am submitting documentation that she received this manual from our technician. In addition, she attended two XXXX training weekends. The dates are as follows : XXXX XXXX for 16 hours as well as XXXX XXXX for 16 hours. She received a total of 32 training hours as well as our manual. Lastly, XXXX XXXX came to our XXXX daily. We have an online scheduling system. She had obtained a username and password and signed herself in daily. The dates that she attended our facility to receive training, XXXX and XXXX XXXX are attached as documentation in support of this claim. The total hours are : 127 hours. For a grand total of 159 hours. XXXX XXXX sent me an email directly to tell me that she was leaving the program and receiving a full refund from XXXX XXXX. She sent me an email explaining that the outline for the XXXX training program was false and that she did not receive services that were promised. This is not accurate. Her complaints / accusations were as follows : 1 ) "" Program details stated that apprentices would be able to access the XXXX Monday - Friday from XXXX XXXX, and Saturdays from XXXX - XXXX. There have been multiple occurrences where I have been denied access to the studio to observe, practice or XXXX during times when the training program details state the studio would be open. '' RESPONSE : XXXX XXXX was required to schedule herself on our online scheduling system in ADVANCE. She did not do this, rather she did this the day of prior to coming in to the XXXX. In addition, XXXX XXXX did not come to our XXXX at XXXX XXXX in the morning since she began the training. The times that she came to our XXXX were noted above. Lastly, I explained to XXXX XXXX that our studio had been vandalized on Saturday the XXXX and that there was broken glass which was dangerous and our door needed to be replaced on Monday morning from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. She seized this opportunity to demand a refund because we were unable to make the XXXX available to her during this time period. Pease note : I have a picture of this occurrence and I am submitting it as documentation. 2 ) "" Additionally, although the training fee states that I would have unlimited access to the studio to observe, practice and XXXX, it was made aware to me after paying for the program fee, that if I XXXX someone not currently an apprentice or employee of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I would have to pay a {$25.00} studio rental fee, even if during the hours outlined as being able to have unlimited open studio access to observe, practice and XXXX. '' RESPONSE : It was explained in great detail to XXXX XXXX, at the BEGINNING of the program, that she was able to XXXX  employees and fellow apprentices for no charge ( included in the cost of our program ). In addition, if she wanted to XXXX clients that would like to pay for discounted apprentice sessions, she could do so and would be paid for doing so. XXXX XXXX agreed to this. Please note : I am submitting her XXXX and deposited pay check. Lastly, XXXX XXXX wanted to teach her husband XXXX XXXX. This was not a requirement. She did not want him to pay the XXXX for discounted sessions nor to be paid for XXXX  him. I agreed to her request but explained that a XXXX fee of {$25.00} was to be paid if she wanted to XXXX him specifically. This was NOT a requirement. 3 ) "" The program details provided before submitting payment for the training fee, also states that there will be a monthly apprentice meeting/XXXX. The training program began on XXXX XXXX, and I was not provided with the first monthly/apprentice meetingXXXX. '' RESPONSE : There are a total of 8 apprentice meetings, held once a month. Apprentice meetings begin in XX/XX/XXXXand end in XXXX of XXXX. This was explained to XXXX XXXX at the BEGINNING of the program. 4 ) "" As required, prior to signing up for the program and paying the program training fee, I submitted an application outlining my experience with XXXX. Since the program has begun, I have been told on multiple occasions that I not capable of completing training program unless I take multiple classes/privates all which come at an additional charge, not outlined in the program details. '' RESPONSE : XXXX XXXX was NEVER told that she was not capable of completing the training program unless she took classes and/or private sessions. Also, please note on XXXX XXXX 's application, she did not disclose that she had a physical/medical condition called XXXX She was concerned because her XXXX was bothering her. It was then that I realized she had XXXX. I asked her about this and why she did not communicate this to me PRIOR to beginning the program. She explained that she was concerned that I would NOT accept her into the program if she had been honest about her condition. She asked me directly what she could do additionally to enhance her training experience. I recommended taking classes and sessions but this was NEVER deemed a requirement. Please note : I am submitting her application as proof that she did not disclose her medical condition to XXXX XXXX XXXX CONCLUSION : I feel that the reversal of the {$6000.00} charge once again is unwarranted and unfounded. Based upon the foregoing information, it is respectfully requested that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX reverse the refund given to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$6000.00} and return the amount to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX respectfully.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['case', 'xxxx', 'merchant', 'xxxx', 'reference', 'xxxx', 'ticketcardholder', 'xxxx', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx',

Bank employees gave this person a new ATM card with access to my account. He subsequently withdrew {$800.00} from an ATM and additional {$6000.00} was personally withdrawn via a teller.

0,2,20,82,"XXXX my daughters bank of america ATM card was stolen via an XXXX she shared with other teenagers She did not discover her ATM was missing until a few days later when she checked her balance noticed a check for {$5900.00} was deposited and {$300.00} withdrawn. She contacted bank of america spoke with customer service told them she did not authorize transaction. A new atm card was issued with new pin. 2 weeks later she received a letter from BOA stating they are reversing the credit applied and they determined their decision was correct. I then got involved requested ATM footage etc. I reviewed ATM footage with a branch manager and my daughter. The person on ATM was a XXXX male. At that time my daughter recognized the guy as being on of the kids in the XXXX she was sharing prior to the incident. I asked how he got access to her pin. She advised another young girl riding in the XXXX was asking questions like what school you go to, whens your birthday etc. WHICH NOTE : her pin at the time was her Date of Birth. We also seen copies of the check it was a XXXX XXXX personal check. The person spelled my daughters name incorrectly on the check. Also the person who signed the check also endorsed it on the back. Bank of America has a male suspect on video footage, and check that incorrectly spelled my daughters name and was endorsed incorrectly. Since XXXX XXXX I have been calling trying to dispute. I was told I need to file police report. Which I have done and I have faxed and still Bank of America is refusing to investigate this fairly. Bank of America Fraud continues to say their findings are correct. Their reason is no one would be able to access her ATM and deposit with her personal information. As That is information she would only know. This happens to consumers everyday and is not uncommon. Unfortunately my daughter was a victim of crime. An innocent conversation in an XXXX resulted in her card getting stolen and her pin getting breached. The evidence on the ATM footage shows she did not deposit the check. Also the check image itself shows the person did not even spell my daughters name correctly. The person that signed the front also endorsed the back. Yet None of these factors are being taken into consideration. Instead Bank of America fraud just denies my claim says their findings are correct. Per the reasons I noted above. While in most cases that would be true. But when your Pin is your DOB. Fact remains consumers are more susceptible to fraud. Unfortunately my daughter being a minor when she opened her account set her pin as her DOB. The banks run across this every day and for Bank of America not to even take the time to look into this issue. I am starting to feel like because I am a minority. I am being treated like the criminal instead of looking at the facts before them. Between the footage & the check discrepancies I pointed out. Bank of America can not make a clear determination their findings are correct. Meanwhile The representatives in the fraud department have treated me rudely spoken to me in a condescending manor. Despite being a customer with the bank for well over 15 years. Not to mention I have mortgage through Bank of America. I called again today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and again was treated like a criminal. I was told I can not speak to anyone there is no one that I can escalate this to and if I do not have any more documentation than the letter and the police report I sent. Bank of America Fraud investigator handling my claim will continue to deny my request. I am a consumer caught in the middle of a fraud situation and there is actual evidence that shows there was someone else involved. That person has gotten away with a crime. I am left to hold the bag. 
Today I have contacted my local news company XXXX XXXX. I am contacting CFPB and I am writing Bank of America head quarters. I had 3 open accounts. The account in question bank of america charged off and is now reflecting this on mine and my daughters credit and is possibly even in the XXXX XXXX. We are being penalized for being a customer.

I contacted Bank of America informing them of the tax exemption. Bank of America continued to place illegal escrow, forced placed insurance ( self purchased insurance copies included ), special assessments, miscellaneous postings, late fees, misapplied payments and escrow shortage charges. With tax exempt accounts, there should not ever be escrow charged to the account. Either way, my account should never have been charged.
<P/>
Thirdly, please review my credit history ( included ) printed on XX/XX/XXXX. No missed payments except for Bank of America. My credit history for all other accounts have an A+ payment history. Bank of America, fraudulently reported negative payment history to the credit bureaus. With my mortgage loan having a signed escrow waiver agreement and my 100 % tax exemption status due to my XX/XX/XXXX military XXXX rating, the escrow payments should not ever have been collected. Me and my family have suffered unnecessary hardship because of Bank of America 's fraudulent charges, incorrect credit reporting and excessive fees.
<P/>
On XX/XX/XXXX, my credit report was marked as 120 days late. I contacted XXXX, at Bank of America, for my account to be reviewed, due to my new tax exemption status. He stated that my account had been reviewed, per my request, and that B.O.A was making corrections to my account and would send the updated credit report to the credit bureaus. On credit report date, XX/XX/XXXX, B.O.A had made the necessary corrections and marked my mortgage account as "" pays account as agreed ''. This year, XXXX, Bank of America made major changes to my credit report by stating that my mortgage account had 25 missed payments. All of the errors on my account are completely illogical.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['firstly', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'purchased', 'my', 'loan', 'from', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'company', 'xxxx', 'had', 'just', 'dropped', 'the', 'illegal', 'escrow', 'account', 'due', 'to', 'a', 'letter', 'written', 'to', 'the', 'texas', 'attorney', 'general', 's', 'office', 'we', 'were', 'never', 'reimbursed', 'the', 'overpayments', 'made', 'to', 'xxxx', 'however', 'when', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'purchased', 'the', 'loan', 'they', 'added', 'the', 'escrow', 'account', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'account', 'at', 'a', 'deficit', 'my', 'original', 'loan', 'dated', 'xxxxxxxx', 'includes', 'a', 'signed', 'escrow', 'waiver', 'agreement', 'that', 'states', 'i', 'requested', 'a', 'nonescrowed', 'account', 'document', 'included', 'i', 'also', 'signed', 'a', 'truth', 'in', 'lending', 'disclosure', 'statement', 'document', 'included', 'that', 'ensures', 'i', 'am', 'responsible', 'to', 'pay', 'my', 'own', 'insurance', 'and', 'property', 'taxes', 'p', 'secondly', 'the', 'mortgage', 'account', 'was', 'tax', 'exempt', 'during', 'the', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'years', 'due', 'to', 'my', 'military', 'service', 'i', 'am', 'a', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'veteran', 'document', 'included', 'i', 'contacted', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'informing', 'them', 'of', 'the', 'tax', 'exemption', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'continued', 'to', 'place', 'illegal', 'escrow', 'forced', 'placed', 'insurance', 'self', 'purchased', 'insurance', 'copies', 'included', 'special', 'assessments', 'miscellaneous', 'postings', 'late', 'fees', 'misapplied', 'payments', 'and', 'escrow', 'shortage', 'charges', 'with', 'tax', 'exempt', 'accounts', 'there', 'should', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'escrow', 'charged', 'to', 'the', 'account', 'either', 'way', 'my', 'account', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'charged', 'p', 'thirdly', 'please', 'review', 'my', 'credit', 'history', 'included', 'printed', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'no', 'missed', 'payments', 'except', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'my', 'credit', 'history', 'for', 'all', 'other', 'accounts', 'have', 'an', 'a', 'payment', 'history', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'fraudulently', 'reported', 'negative', 'payment', 'history', 'to', 'the', 'credit', 'bureaus', 'with', 'my', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'having', 'a', 'signed', 'escrow', 'waiver', 'agreement', 'and', 'my', 'one hundred', 'tax', 'exemption', 'status', 'due', 'to', 'my', 'xxxxxxxx', 'military', 'xxxx', 'rating', 'the', 'escrow', 'payments', 'should', 'not', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'collected', 'me', 'and', 'my', 'family', 'have', 'suffered', 'unnecessary', 'hardship', 'because', 'of', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 's', 'fraudulent', 'charges', 'incorrect', 'credit', 'reporting', 'and', 'excessive', 'fees', 'p', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'my', 'credit', 'report', 'was', 'marked', 'as', 'one hundred and twenty', 'days', 'late', 'i', 'contacted', 'xxxx', 'at', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'for', 'my', 'account', 'to', 'be', 'reviewed', 'due', 'to', 'my', 'new', 'tax', 'exemption', 'status', 'he', 'stated', 'that', 'my', 'account', 'had', 'been', 'reviewed', 'per', 'my', 'request', 'and', 'that', 'boa', 'was', 'making', 'corrections', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'would', 'send', 'the', 'updated', 'credit', 'report', 'to', 'the', 'credit', 'bureaus', 'on', 'credit', 'report', 'date', 'xxxxxxxx', 'boa', 'had', 'made', 'the', 'necessary', 'corrections', 'and', 'marked', 'my', 'mortgage', 'account', 'as', 'pays', 'account', 'as', 'agreed', 'this', 'year', 'xxxx', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'made', 'major', 'changes', 'to', 'my', 'credit', 'report', 'by', 'stating', 'that', 'my', 'mortgage', 'account', 'had', 'twenty-five', 'missed', 'payments', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'errors', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'are', 'completely', 'illogical']"

3,13,2,42,"This complaint stems from a decade-old foreclosure case, and specifically involves the attempted collection of a 'dormant ' mortgage debt. Ohio law is crystal clear that when a debt is not 'executed upon ' or 'renewed ' within a five-year period, the debt is considered dormant, and the lien is extinguished. Ohio law further defines the 'execution ' of debt to as "" a process of court, issued by its clerk, and directed to the sheriff of the county. '' ( XXXX XXXX ). In my case, there was no 'execution ' as defined above, nor a 'certificate of judgment ' renewed during the period of time from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. As such, the Summary Judgment issues by the Court of Common Please became dormant on XX/XX/XXXX. Nonetheless, on three occasions since that time - specifically XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX - the alleged Plaintiff in my case file a Praecipe Order of Sale with the Court in what amounts to an attempt to collect a debt that I currently do not owe as a result of the statutorily-imposed dormancy. The specific statute is Ohio Revised Code 2329.07, which codifies when a Judgment may become dormant : ( A ) (( 1 ) If neither execution on a judgment rendered in a court of record or certified to the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the judgment was rendered is issued, nor a certificate of judgment for obtaining a lien upon lands and tenements is issued and filed, as provided in sections 2329.02 and 2329.04 of the Revised Code, within five years from the date of the judgment or within five years from the date of the issuance of the last execution thereon or the issuance and filing of the last such certificate, whichever is later, then, unless the judgment is in favor of the state, the judgment shall be dormant and shall not operate as a lien upon the estate of the judgment debtor. One bankruptcy judge has explained the operation of these statutes as follows from In XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. Ohio XX/XX/XXXX ) : Execution and dormancy statutes are to be strictly construed. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ohio St. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Ohio XX/XX/XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 13 Kan. App. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Okla. XXXX ).
Section XXXX  sets forth the only means in Ohio for preventing a judgment from becoming dormant. The clear language of the statute requires the issuance of execution or a certificate of judgment before expiration of the original five-year period to prevent dormancy.
Section XXXX  provides that in order to extend the effectiveness of a judgment beyond the initial five  year period there must be either execution or the issuance of a new certificate of judgment before expiration of the original execution or certificate of judgment. As a result of the above, the law is clear that the judgment is dormant, and any action to collect on the debt is a violation of state and federal law.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['this', 'complaint', 'stems', 'from', 'a', 'decadeold', 'foreclosure', 'case', 'and', 'specifically', 'involves', 'the', 'attempted', 'collection', 'of', 'a', 'dormant', 'mortgage', 'debt', 'ohio', 'law', 'is', 'crystal', 'clear', 'that', 'when', 'a', 'debt', 'is', 'not', 'executed', 'upon', 'or', 'renewed', 'within', 'a', 'fiveyear', 'period', 'the', 'debt', 'is', 'considered', 'dormant', 'and', 'the', 'lien', 'is', 'extinguished', 'ohio', 'law', 'further', 'defines', 'the', 'execution', 'of', 'debt', 'to', 'as', 'a', 'process', 'of', 'court', 'issued', 'by', 'its', 'clerk', 'and', 'directed', 'to', 'the', 'sheriff', 'of', 'the', 'county', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'in', 'my', 'case', 'there', 'was', 'no', 'execution', 'as', 'defined', 'above', 'nor', 'a', 'certificate', 'of', 'judgment', 'renewed', 'during', 'the', 'period', 'of', 'time', 'from', 'xxxxxxxx', 'through', 'xxxxxxxx', 'as', 'such', 'the', 'summary', 'judgment', 'issues', 'by', 'the', 'court', 'of', 'common', 'please', 'became', 'dormant', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'nonetheless', 'on', 'three', 'occasions', 'since', 'that', 'time', 'specifically', 'xxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxx', 'and', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'alleged', 'plaintiff', 'in', 'my', 'case', 'file', 'a', 'praecipe', 'order', 'of', 'sale', 'with', 'the', 'court', 'in', 'what', 'amounts', 'to', 'an', 'attempt', 'to', 'collect', 'a', 'debt', 'that', 'i', 'currently', 'do', 'not', 'owe', 'as', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'the', 'statutorilyimposed', 'dormancy', 'the', 'specific', 'statute', 'is', 'ohio', 'revised', 'code', 'two hundred and thirty-two thousand, nine hundred and seven', 'which', 'codifies', 'when', 'a', 'judgment', 'may', 'become', 'dormant', 'a', 'one', 'if', 'neither', 'execution', 'on', 'a', 'judgment', 'rendered', 'in', 'a', 'court', 'of', 'record', 'or', 'certified', 'to', 'the', 'clerk', 'of', 'the', 'court', 'of', 'common', 'pleas', 'in', 'the', 'county', 'in', 'which', 'the', 'judgment', 'was', 'rendered', 'is', 'issued', 'nor', 'a', 'certificate', 'of', 'judgment', 'for', 'obtaining', 'a', 'lien', 'upon', 'lands', 'and', 'tenements', 'is', 'issued', 'and', 'filed', 'as', 'provided', 'in', 'sections', 'two hundred and thirty-two thousand, nine hundred and two', 'and', 'two hundred and thirty-two thousand, nine hundred and four', 'of', 'the', 'revised', 'code', 'within', 'five', 'years', 'from', 'the', 'date', 'of', 'the', 'judgment', 'or', 'within', 'five', 'years', 'from', 'the', 'date', 'of', 'the', 'issuance', 'of', 'the', 'last', 'execution', 'thereon', 'or', 'the', 'issuance', 'and', 'filing', 'of', 'the', 'last', 'such', 'certificate', 'whichever', 'is', 'later', 'then', 'unless', 'the', 'judgment', 'is', 'in', 'favor', 'of', 'the', 'state', 'the', 'judgment', 'shall', 'be', 'dormant', 'and', 'shall', 'not', 'operate', 'as', 'a', 'lien', 'upon', 'the', 'estate', 'of', 'the', 'judgment', 'debtor', 'one', 'bankruptcy', 'judge', 'has', 'explained', 'the', 'operation', 'of', 'these', 'statutes', 'as', 'follows', 'from', 'in', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'ohio', 'xxxxxxxx', 'execution', 'and', 'dormancy', 'statutes', 'are', 'to', 'be', 'strictly', 'construed', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'ohio', 'st', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'ohio', 'xxxxxxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'thirteen', 'kan', 'app', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'okla', 'xxxx', 'section', 'xxxx', 'sets', 'forth', 'the', 'only', 'means', 'in', 'ohio', 'for', 'preventing', 'a', 'judgment', 'from', 'becoming', 'dormant', 'the', 'clear', 'language', 'of', 'the', 'statute', 'requires', 'the', 'issuance', 'of', 'execution', 'or', 'a', 'certificate', 'of', 'judgment', 'before', 'expiration', 'of', 'the', 'original', 'fiveyear', 'period', 'to', 'prevent', 'dormancy', 'section', 'xxxx', 'provides', 'that', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'extend', 'the', 'effectiveness', 'of', 'a', 'judgment', 'beyond', 'the', 'initial', 'five', 'year', 'period', 'there', 'must', 'be', 'either', 'execution', 'or', 'the', 'issuance', 'of', 'a', 'new', 'certificate', 'of', 'judgment', 'before', 'expiration', 'of', 'the', 'original', 'execution', 'or', 'certificate', 'of', 'judgment', 'as', 'a', 'result', 'of', 'the', 'above', 'the', 'law', 'is', 'clear', 'that', 'the', 'judgment', 'is', 'dormant', 'and', 'any', 'action', 'to', 'collect', 'on', 'the', 'debt', 'is', 'a', 'violation', 'of', 'state', 'and', 'federal', 'law']"

This is also in direct contradiction to a letter mailed to me that the funds were to be reversed on the XXXX of the month not the XXXX.

0,2,24,77,"I am highly disappointed with Bank Of America refusal to be customer centric regarding the overdraft, non-sufficient funds and extended overdraft fees that I have been assessed over the past year. One of the reason I chose to bank with BOA was because I heard of their desire to consistently deliver the exemplary service they know that their customers deserve. On several occasions, I have contacted customer service requesting assistance or direction with banking concerns and have only ended the call inquiring as to why instead of creating solutions for their customers, I 'm still in the predicament of where I started. I contacted the bank of XX/XX/XXXX regarding an unauthorized transaction to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$36.00} that I had been paying for a product that I returned and because I had other transactions coming from that merchant, that it never dawned on me that I had returned those 2 items in which that charge was payment for.that I had been paying. I had been charged 11xs in this amount. Instead of providing a solution, the agent did everything in her power to keep me from filing any type of claim for the transaction and when I asked for a stop payment, she simply said that she could place a stop payment on the merchant for a fee. My question to myself is that, I have never received a stop payment before or any type of reimbursement for a fee for that matter and if this is causing financial hardship since she refuses to allow me to file a claim, why not provide the stop payment as a courtesy. In regards to the fees that I previously mentioned, a review of my account has indicated that I have paid {$1000.00} in overdraft, non-sufficient funds and extended overdraft fees since XX/XX/XXXX. By all means I know that as a customer, it is my responsibility to manage my account effectively ; however, there may be times in which are outside of my control and I have tried to discuss the matter with phone bankers but I 'm always told that they are unable to assist with fees and to only bring the account to a positive balance or I will get hit with additional extended fees. I am submitting this as a request for some type of reimbursement for some of the fees that I have incurred over the past year. Although I understand by using the account, I accept the terms and condition of the account and the fees that I am subjective to ... but as a consumer, sometimes its nice to know that a company values you as a customer and realizes that you may have made a miscalculation or misjudgment and be willing to say, as a courtesy,  we understand and want to keep you as a customer. I ask that you review my account relationship and provide a reimbursement for the fees that I have been assessed. The only fee reversals that I have received where the result of unauthorized transactions. Thank you for your time.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'am', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'refusal', 'to', 'be', 'customer', 'centric', 'regarding', 'the', 'overdraft', 'nonsufficient', 'funds', 'and', 'extended', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'assessed', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'year', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'reason', 'i', 'chose', 'to', 'bank', 'with', 'boa', 'was', 'because', 'i', 'heard', 'of', 'their', 'desire', 'to', 'consistently', 'deliver', 'the', 'exemplary', 'service', 'they', 'know', 'that', 'their', 'customers', 'deserve', 'on', 'several', 'occasions', 'i', 'have', 'contacted', 'customer', 'service', 'requesting', 'assistance', 'or', 'direction', 'with', 'banking', 'concerns', 'and', 'have', 'only', 'ended', 'the', 'call', 'inquiring', 'as', 'to', 'why', 'instead', 'of', 'creating', 'solutions', 'for', 'their', 'customers', 'i', 'm', 'still', 'in', 'the', 'predicament', 'of', 'where', 'i', 'started', 'i', 'contacted', 'the', 'bank', 'of', 'xxxxxxxx', 'regarding', 'an', 'unauthorized', 'transaction', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'in', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'three thousand, six hundred', 'that', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'for', 'a', 'product', 'that', 'i', 'returned', 'and', 'because', 'i', 'had', 'other', 'transactions', 'coming', 'from', 'that', 'merchant', 'that', 'it', 'never', 'dawned', 'on', 'me', 'that', 'i', 'had', 'returned', 'those', 'two', 'items', 'in', 'which', 'that', 'charge', 'was', 'payment', 'forthat', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'charged', '11xs', 'in', 'this', 'amount', 'instead', 'of', 'providing', 'a', 'solution', 'the', 'agent', 'did', 'everything', 'in', 'her', 'power', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'from', 'filing', 'any', 'type', 'of', 'claim', 'for', 'the', 'transaction', 'and', 'when', 'i', 'asked', 'for', 'a', 'stop', 'payment', 'she', 'simply', 'said', 'that', 'she', 'could', 'place', 'a', 'stop', 'payment', 'on', 'the', 'merchant', 'for', 'a', 'fee', 'my', 'question', 'to', 'myself', 'is', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'received', 'a', 'stop', 'payment', 'before', 'or', 'any', 'type', 'of', 'reimbursement', 'for', 'a', 'fee', 'for', 'that', 'matter', 'and', 'if', 'this', 'is', 'causing', 'financial', 'hardship', 'since', 'she', 'refuses', 'to', 'allow', 'me', 'to', 'file', 'a', 'claim', 'why', 'not', 'provide', 'the', 'stop', 'payment', 'as', 'a', 'courtesy', 'in', 'regards', 'to', 'the', 'fees', 'that', 'i', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'a', 'review', 'of', 'my', 'account', 'has', 'indicated', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'paid', 'one hundred thousand', 'in', 'overdraft', 'nonsufficient', 'funds', 'and', 'extended', 'overdraft', 'fees', 'since', 'xxxxxxxx', 'by', 'all', 'means', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'as', 'a', 'customer', 'it', 'is', 'my', 'responsibility', 'to', 'manage', 'my', 'account', 'effectively', 'however', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'times', 'in', 'which', 'are', 'outside', 'of', 'my', 'control', 'and', 'i', 'have', 'tried', 'to', 'discuss', 'the', 'matter', 'with', 'phone', 'bankers', 'but', 'i', 'm', 'always', 'told', 'that', 'they', 'are', 'unable', 'to', 'assist', 'with', 'fees', 'and', 'to', 'only', 'bring', 'the', 'account', 'to', 'a', 'positive', 'balance', 'or', 'i', 'will', 'get', 'hit', 'with', 'additional', 'extended', 'fees', 'i', 'am', 'submitting', 'this', 'as', 'a', 'request', 'for', 'some', 'type', 'of', 'reimbursement', 'for', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'fees', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'incurred', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'year', 'although', 'i', 'understand', 'by', 'using', 'the', 'account', 'i', 'accept', 'the', 'terms', 'and', 'condition', 'of', 'the', 'account', 'and', 'the', 'fees', 'that', 'i', 'am', 'subjective', 'to', 'but', 'as', 'a', 'consumer', 'sometimes', 'its', 'nice', 'to', 'know', 'that', 'a', 'company', 'values', 'you', 'as', 'a', 'customer', 'and', 'realizes', 'that', 'you', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'a', 'miscalculation', 'or', 'misjudgment', 'and', 'be', 'willing', 'to', 'say', 'as', 'a', 'courtesy', 'we', 'understand', 'and', 'want', 'to', 'keep', 'you', 'as', 'a', 'customer', 'i', 'ask', 'that', 'you', 'review', 'my', 'account', 'relationship', 'and', 'provide', 'a', 'reimbursement', 'for', 'the', 'fees', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'assessed', 'the', 'only', 'fee', 'reversals', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'received', 'where', 'the', 'result', 'of', 'unauthorized', 'transactions', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'your', 'time']"

6,11,21,9,"I paid my auto loan in the months of XXXX and XXXX. Company claimed they never received a payment but made no good efforts to inform me of non-payment Called BOA on XXXX in an attempt to make my auto loan payment. Spoke with a rep who said he would transfer me to another dept. While speaking with the new rep she said that she had to transfer me to another dept. due to my auto loan payment being delinquent 64 days. I asked her how was that possible when I 've paid for the past two months, she said that it was n't her dept. but she saw where payments had been made but something "" funny '' was going on with the account. I was placed on hold and then spoke to another rep whom stated the same thing, that my payment was 64 days late. She then said that it could 've been due to wrong account number/being a number off etc. I then asked why was n't I informed about my loan being 64 days past due, especially due to the fact that I had just spoke with a CSR last month and I was n't informed about it being late. I further asked why did n't I receive a phone call, letter in the mail, or even a basic email. I also told her that I had emails from BOA stating that my payments had been made, which she basically told me that those emails meant nothing ( why send emails with confirmation numbers saying payments have been made if no payments are received, or why not send emails saying that no payment has been received, seems a little backwards ) You can send emails saying that the payments had been made but none saying that it might 've came back and not been made. The CSR rep then went on to tell me that multiple calls had been made but my phone line was continuously busy ( Learned from a BOA manager on XXXX that they had all the wrong contact information concerning my account ) She then asked would I like to speak to a bank manager to which I agreed. I was put on hold and told that they were in a meeting and that they would call me back, She then proceeded to be nasty and ask for my phone number and ask, "" are you gon na be home to answer the phone this time? '' Lets just say that I NEVER received a phone call from the bank manager and had to call back ( XXXX ) myself to figure out the issue. Spoke with a gentleman name XXXX who basically told me the same garb as I was previously fed. When I asked him when was I ever gon na be notified that my account was delinquent or were they gon na just come and repo the car he snickered and He basically said that I would have to go through the hassle of getting banking statements that the payments were made and that the research team would try and locate the missing funds, which I feel like I should n't have to go through the trouble since NO ONE went through the trouble of informing me about my account being delinquent. He then tried to verify my contact info, which was all wrong ( do n't quite know where they got this information from. ) he then stated that 's why I have n't been receiving notifications, which I still find inexcusable due to the fact that BOA can send me a notification via email on multiple occasions asking me to complete a survey about my call but no notification to inform me that the loan that they are financing is delinquent ( again backwards ) and as of today ( XXXX ) I still ca n't pay my auto loan due to notes that were placed in the system and all it does is connect me to a

1,8,30,35,On XXXX a transaction of {$7600.00} was made at Hawaii XXXX in XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX county. I received a call from Bank of America alerting me to the transaction. They asked me if I was the one that performed the transaction and I said I did not. Immediately a fraud dispute was initiated. This was a visa purchase made at the grocery store based on the information on my statement. Bank of America issued a temporary credit in that amount following the dispute. On XXXX the bank reversed the transaction and recharged me the entire amount to my account. On XXXX I received the attached notification that the bank would not follow through with the fraud dispute. They claim that this was a cash advance/ATM transaction. This is not consistent with the information listed on my statement and the information provided to me by the bank. I do not believe the bank performed it 's due diligence in researching the fraud.

0,2,24,10,"I applied to several XXXX postings at XXXX and one of them was from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The first email I received was XXXX XXXX 2017 from an email XXXX saying that it was tough to decide on the select group chosen for an interview because they received so many good resumes and that I was one of those selected for an interview. <P/>I was asked to add XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on the XXXX XXXX platform to undergo the interview process. According to them, she was an HR recruiter for XXXX. This XXXX person gave me all the duties and responsibilities of the position and asked me if I could handle the job duties if I were being trained towards it, I responded by saying yes, then she proceeded with interview questions. Once we finished, she said to check back by XXXX the following day via the XXXX XXXX platform for the decision. The next day they said I was chosen. <P/>I received another email from XXXX congratulating me for becoming part of their company and they attached an offer letter. <P/>Then they emailed me a check {$3000.00}. on XX/XX/2017 with instructions on how to deposit it via mobile through my bank Bank of America, and that I was expected to cash {$2800.00} of it and deposit to a XXXX XXXX account the following day to a person named XXXX XXXX XXXX who is the vendor in charge of sending me the training materials for pre-training. I believed it and so I did, I also thought that since Bank of America made the funds available the next day, then it was a legitimate check. On XX/XX/2017 they emailed me another check for {$4000.00}. and from there I had withdraw and deposit {$3900.00}. for more materials. <P/>OnXX/XX/XXXX. I went to what I thought was my first day of my internship at XXXX and the security guard could not find my name in their system. I was told that I was actually scammed and that they were very sorry this happened to me, and that someone also got scammed that same morning. <P/>I went straight to the police station and made a police report, I also contacted Bank of America but they are not cooperating with me regarding my situation. Instead they withdrew my checking and savings accounts to pay themselves back from the fraudulent checks. Now I have negative status on my account of - {$6200.00}.

I explained to the Risk Dept Rep that I went through the Banks Risk management and was cleared so I do not understand why my account was being closed. She then transferred me to an automated system ( after I asked to speak to someone who could tell me who the other Banking institution was ). This automated system would n't allow me to speak to anyone. Do to Bank of America 's Risk assessment system and the lack of proper business professionalism I suffered humiliation but having my card declined and not being able to pay for my purchase.

0,2,20,47,"Bank of Americas check hold policy/risk department literally put me and my fiance in harms way being out at sea without the insurance we tried to purchase before the trip. We sold our home in XXXX California and drove across country to pursue our dream of living on a boat and travelling. We had a credit union in California but needed to open an account that would hopefully allow us easier access to our funds. On XX/XX/XXXX I went into the XXXX, Florida branch to deposit the funds from my credit union in California. I spent over an hour with a branch manager to make sure that I understood their Hold Notice ( see attached ). They give you {$200.00} upfront and then Hold code A was supposed to be released allowing me access to {$4800.00} and then hold D was to be released on XX/XX/XXXX for the remaining balance of {$15000.00}. Neither of those dates were honored even though I have the Notice of Hold outlining the dates and amounts. ( see attachments ) I was not notified by phone, e-mail, or text that they were not honoring the hold notice. I was informed at the grocery store by the cashier that my card did not go through. Upon my effort to find out why, I was informed that they did not release the {$4800.00} and that the {$15000.00} was going to be held until XX/XX/XXXX. The risk department wanted to place the burden of proof on me that the check had actually cleared. Now, that I dont have internet access what they want me to produce is not possible. They blamed my credit union saying that would not verify the check had cleared. The credit union offered to do a three way call with them to validate that the check cleared. That was not possible because the risk department much like the XXXX XXXX XXXX never speaks to the customer. I was able to supply them with the front and back of the check but that did not suffice. Apparently it takes 24 hours to escalate within the risk department so now we have lost yet another day. I spent three full days trying to resolve this to no avail. All I received was lobotomy type responses from all of their terrified employees to go off script and try and help. We did run into trouble and did need to get towed to the tune of {$1300.00} ( see attached receipt ). BofAs draconian, arbitrary, greedy hold policies turned what was supposed to be a beautiful trip into a XXXX nightmare.

0,2,20,47,"On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I was messaged by a user via an online dating app, whom I believed was flirting with me. Her profile name was XXXX, I asked her what she was looking for and said she said needed help completing a business transaction. XXXX proceeded to explain that she works for FDIC and completes transfers between accounts of business clients he/she worked for and in order for her to get paid or get her "" cut '' she needed help depositing the checks into an account, which then I would withdraw the funds and send to XXXX a relative, or an assistant via XXXX XXXX. I asked her how she intended to complete the deposits. She asked me if I had mobile/online banking and with whom. I stated that i did have that service with Bank of America. I gave her my phone number in order to call me because she specified not being comfortable with talking through the dating app. Later that evening I received a text stating "" Ok I am ready to deposit my checks and appreciate the help ''. She asked me for my BOA username and password and she reassured me that this was only because she was in possession of the checks that required depositing and so she would need to access the account, and so I gave her my online user ID and Password, along with the answer to whatever security question came up. Luckily the security questions were n't as viable information but I still made the biggest mistake of my life the moment I gave them my username and password. That evening at XXXX I received several emails and texts notifications showing that this person deposited four checks of "" hers '' into my account ( {$990.00}, {$920.00}, XXXX, & {$790.00} ). She made sure to check in with me frequently to ensure I did not log into my online banking account which I did not think anything of it because I sometimes manage my mothers account and she and I can not be logged in at the same time. She then said to me, "" Ok, I completed my deposits please do not sign into your account until the deposits are complete and processed ''. I said, well that will be a couple of days and they said, "" no, the funds should clear in the morning, would you mind going to the bank when it opens to withdraw cash and send me my portion via XXXX XXXX. '' At that moment I was confused, but I went ahead and went to the bank Friday XX/XX/XXXX. Before I left, she texted me a screen shot of my mobile banking showing an available balance of {$3600.00} in my checking account as of XXXX from the timestamp on the phone the screen shot was taken. I received the screen shot text around XXXX and did n't notice the time stamp. I was called an ber around XXXX and was asked to withdraw {$2200.00}. The ber took me to a BOA with a financial center, the first one I went to had ATM tellers and neither of them were working. I told XXXX that I had to go XXXX and would be willing to try again later. At XXXX I made it to a local branch and went to a teller window which I then withdrew {$2200.00} and sent {$2000.00} to a "" XXXX XXXX XXXX in Indiana via XXXX XXXX for a total of {$2100.00}. The XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX placed the transaction on a hold I did not know why, I let XXXX know that this was happening and she told me, to state "" this person was my sister ... and the amount was for rent. '' and I assumed that XXXX was XXXX XXXXs sister and I knew XXXX would n't send it if I they knew I was sending it for another person. After I spoke to XXXX they released the money and I sent a picture of the receipt to "" XXXX '' She said, "" Thank you so much, I will complete my last deposits this evening and you will be able to go back to your account no problem. '' I then proceeded to ask her, "" are you sure everything is ok because I can not see my account please do n't do anything. '' XXXX said to me, "" I would not do anything to jeopardize your account but most importantly my career. '' I said, "" ok, I will trust you and help you in hopes this is the last time because I only expected this to be a quick one-time thing. '' She said, "" After tomorrow you can be done. '' At this time I was still sure I was helping someone in need. Early Friday evening at XXXX I get an email an text notifications of mobile checks being deposited in the amount of ( {$970.00}, XXXX XXXX & XXXX ). Saturday XXXX XXXX at XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX of BOA , I was not aware of what  department she called from. XXXX stated, "" This is not a solicitation call I need to verify some activity on your account. '' I could n't answer the call at the time because I was at the XXXX XXXX I work for. I also thought I was aware of the activity on my account. I received a text message from XXXX around XXXXXXXX asking if I was ready to go to a teller? At that point I was ready to be done running around for someone else, I told XXXX I would just withdraw from the ATM around the corner. I was asked to withdraw {$1000.00} in order to send {$900.00} via XXXX. The XXXX XXXX at XXXX is self-service, I enter in my information and entered in the same receiver information as Friday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX. The total cash given to the associate was {$970.00}, I sent XXXX the receipt and she then asked me to send the same amount, {$900.00}, to her "" assistant '' XXXX XXXX located in Indiana. I chose to send the final amount as a debit transaction via the XXXX  app for a total of {$980.00} once completed I sent her a screen shot of the complete transaction as well as screen shot of the receipt emailed to me. I then said ok is everything all set on your end? She said, you will be able to go back into your account around XXXXXXXX this afternoon for sure. I said ok, thank you very much and she said thanks for your help. I thought everything was fine and I knew what I should 've had in my account as far as funds so I proceeded to withdraw normal amounts of cash for myself and continue my normal spending. I received an email on Sunday XXXX XXXX at XXXXXXXX stating there was a hold and a freeze notice on two deposits. I texted XXXX immediately stating there was a hold and a freeze on two or more of the mobile deposits I allowed her to complete. She said I that she was aware but I should not be worried. So at that moment I chose not to worry until Tuesday XXXX XXXX when I received a second call from XXXX and she asked me to verify all of the ATM withdrawals which I said, "" I did complete every single ATM withdrawal. '' XXXX proceeded to say, "" ok ma'am thank you for verifying these transactions '' and the call ended. I then attempted to log into my mobile/online account, I then saw a message telling me to call a number that connected me to a representative from the online banking department where the rep said "" my account has been put in holding and a freeze has been placed on my card because my account is a risk. '' The women then said, "" The checks that were deposited into my account were counterfeit and with all the withdrawals makes my account negative - {$5500.00} as of right now any funds going into your account will be going towards that negative. '' I told the the rep those checks were not mine and I did not deposit them and I did not withdraw the money because at that I was so afraid and did not know what to do or if I could tell the truth, because I know BOA to be very unforgiving. She said, "" ok well your going to have to file a claim with the fraud department. '' I was transferred to the fraud department where I was first connected to ATM fraud claim. I ended up being honest with the woman telling her as I told XXXX, Yes I did complete those transactions and stated I did n't at first because I was scared. So she said ok well I 'm going to transfer you over to check fraud claim after I told the check fraud claim rep that I NEVER saw the checks ever. After I filed the claim I proceeded to ask the rep from the fraud department, "" what does this mean for me, my account, and my relationship with Bank of America? '' She then said, "" Ma'am at this time it is up to the risks department and what they want to do there 's nothing I can do from my end. '' She also stated, "" First they will investigate the check fraud claim, and if you file a police report feel free to tell us and we will cooperate.. '' As of Wednesday XXXX XXXX I have filed a police report but have not yet notified the bank. Prior to them depositing any of "" their checks '' into my checking account I had a remaining balance of {$54.00}, a transfer from my boyfriend of {$170.00}, and a processing deposit from MA unemployment office of {$200.00}. I also had a savings account of {$10.00} which I keep trying to build but ca n't I am a main financial provider for my family. My biggest complaint is that the bank disclosed no information at the time on the first phone call letting me know that the checks were fraud, I did not find out until I had to call because my account had already been somewhat garnished. In sent a total {$4100.00} while I had a balance of {$430.00} and according to the bank statement I received Wednesday XXXX XXXX my account is - {$5500.00}.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL

0,23,20,54,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a checking account with Bank of America in XXXX XXXX XXXX AZ. with {$1000.00}. I did not use the account and actually forgot about it. I do use a BOA credit card and online banking to track and pay each month. Recently I discovered that the BOA has been taking $ XXXX/month out for "" service fees '' since approximatelyXX/XX/XXXX and this amounts to {$770.00} lost!
I spoke with a representative of BOA about ten days ago and was told that nothing can be done to recover the fees even though I was never informed that they would be applied after I had made the original deal to open the account which had no monthly charge with {$1000.00} balance.
I guess that they have some sort of "" hidden wording '' in the original paperwork that I signed when I opened the account but I do not have any records to refer to as I totally forgot the account and trashed the old records a couple of years ago.
In a phone call today BOA told me that the original agreement provides that they can change the charges anytime and do not need my consent, which they did.
My complaint is that while this practice may be legal it is not at all fair to the consumer and should be stopped through regulation by Government agencies responsible for the consumer banking industry. Why should this industry be able to effectively change a contract element without assurance that the parties have been informed and consent to the change.

1,8,1,30,"On XX/XX/XXXX I went to Bank of America branch in TX to take advantage of advertised promotional offer which was displayed on my credit card home page. It said get a 0 % APR for 1 year on transfers into my bank acct from my credit card. The total credit line was {$20000.00}. I had a balance of about {$12000.00} and available credit of {$8000.00}. I took the promotional offer and transferred the {$7700.00} at 0 % APR into my checking acct which I needed to complete a backyard project. I signed a little piece of document at the bank which I plan to attach and the guy at the bank said, XXXX XXXX, this is a great deal because you do n't have to worry about interest on the {$7700.00} as you would just focus on paying off the {$12000.00} because you have reprieve for one year on this one - "" this one '' meaning the amount I just transferred to my bank checking account. I was very excited and  I left. I got Monthly Minimum Payments from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX for {$410.00} which I paid on time for {$410.00} and my assumption was that interest charged on purchases within that period was part of that {$410.00} so I was happy to pay it. By the way interest charged on purchases within that period was {$210.00}. Next Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX for {$400.00}. I was happy to pay it as well thinking interest charged on purchases was included in the Monthly Minimum Payment. By the way interest charged on purchases for that period was {$210.00} which is basically interest charged on outstanding balance. Next Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX for {$420.00}. Which I will be paying in a week. I Interest charged on purchases for that period is {$220.00}. I later called them to ask how my Monthly Minimum Payment was being calculated and they said my Monthly Minimum Payment only applies towards the {$7700.00} that I transferred into my checking account and interest charges on purchases are basically capitalized so I am paying interest on interest every month. I told them that is illegal because a monthly minimum payment on a credit card must include interest payment for the period and they said no it was the responsibility that I took upon myself since I signed on to the promotion. My question is, how is it my responsibility to calculate how much interest I incur on purchases every month and add it to interest on previous balance then plan to pay it above whatever the bank dictates my Minimum Statement is based on the {$7700.00} I transferred. This does not make any logical sense and {$410.00} every month is a lot to pay on a 0 % APR card, just towards the principal. I called Bank of America and told them this smells like Fraud and the representative did not deny it only that he said I signed up for it. I decided to call XXXX XXXX and asked them what their opinion was on the issue and they said monthly Interest payment must be added into a Monthly Minimum Payment. Bank of America is capitalizing the monthly interest and making it difficult for me to make payments on the higher outstanding balance of {$12000.00} ( with Higher APR ) by keeping my Monthly Minimum Payment on the 0 % APR close to {$500.00} a month. They know that it would be difficult for me to make such a high monthly payment ( {$500.00} ) and still be able to pay towards the outstanding balance with high APR. This is fraud of the highest order and the 0 % APR was the trap.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'went', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'branch', 'in', 'tx', 'to',

1,8,1,48,"I XXXX searched, "" Best Credit Cards for XX/XX/XXXX '' the week of XX/XX/XXXX. My desire was to find a new credit card with 0 % purchase period for extended period of time and offer possible cash reward. This financial plan was going to afford me flexibility in paying off my other credit cards in a timely manor without accruing interest on new purchases. After extensive searching, I applied for two credit cards on XX/XX/XXXX through the webpage XXXX. The first card opened was  a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The second card, the problematic and conditional card, was a BankAmericard XXXX provided by Bank of America ( BofA ). I copied verbatim the terms and conditions of the BankAmericard offered through XXXX  and placed it in my notes section of my XXXX. Here is the summary of the offer as stated by XXXX as of my application date of XX/XX/XXXX : '' 0 % Intro Purchases APR until XX/XX/XXXX, 0 % Intro APR for Balance Transfers made within the first 60 days and then 3 % fee for Balance Transfers after May 25, 2017 '' ... meaning, the interest rate would increase to 18.49 % in XX/XX/XXXX after 19 months. Bank of America said I could immediately begin making purchases, so I did. XX/XX/XXXX I received the actual card in the mail I activated it at XXXX hours. By late XX/XX/XXXX I received my first credit card statement and no interest was charged. Payment was made greater than the minimum payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, due dateXX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make essential and non-essential purchases up to this point. The later part of XX/XX/XXXX I received another bill, which is when I noted interest accruing to my account at a high percentage rate of 18.74 %! This was not in my 0 % Intro Purchase APR agreement with Bank of America or XXXX, so I paid greater than my minimum balance and phoned Bank of America. I spoke with XXXX from Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX at  XXXX hours and asked why the terms and conditions had changed since my initial sign up and she said to send a copy of the offer or offers closest to the offer I applied for and fax to her supervisor, XXXX XXXX ( Manager of BofA )XXXXXXXX for further investigation. It took a couple weeks for me to learn how to screen shot from my XXXX, but I came up with several different pages worth of offers from various websites that detailed the exact offer I signed up for, the only exception was my initial offer stated 19 months 0 % Intro Purchase APR and the other offers I found stated 15 months 0 % Intro Purchase APR. I did the leg work and was ready to submit via fax to Bank of America the information they requested. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX hours I printed off the offers and faxed to XXXX XXXX at BofA to XXXX for him to investigate further. I sent several screen shots of my offer, a letter detailing my excellent history with Bank of America and summary of the terms and conditions of the BankAmericard I applied for as advertised by XXXX and plea to rectify the situation. To add insult to an already stressful financial situation, I had to utilize an outside business to transmit the fax because Bank of America does n't have a client-based email system and it cost me another {$9.00} and change for such transaction! After providing all proof and pertinent information to Bank of America per their request, I thought my credit card terms and situation would lead to a full rectification, reimbursement of accruing interest and reinstatement of initial offer. However, the evening of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, XXXX at BofA, telling me he received the information and his plan was to look through everything I 'd provided, for him to make his final determination on the status of my account. He 'd return my phone call with the verdict either later that night or next day. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX phoned to say, "" The screen shots '' I 'd offered and faxed to him "" were only valid after XX/XX/XXXX '' and they "" were n't sufficient '' to reinstate the initial terms and conditions of the card offer because they "" were n't date stamped ''. I explained to XXXX XXXX again that I 'd copied verbatim the terms and conditions, but my proof did n't have a date stamp either. So, his suggestion was to, "" Contact XXXX to get the offer they released on their website '' to show proof of the offer I originally applied for, "" then resubmit '' to Bank of America and his private fax number. Per XXXX XXXX 's suggestion, I immediately looked up the business number to XXXX  and phoned them. XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX hours I left a detailed message at phone number XXXX to a voice mail box of XXXX XXXX Since I had n't received a response from anyone at XXXX over the weekend, I tried again to reach their customer service department, per their website, on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX hours, I left another detailed message with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX hours I phoned XXXX and left more detailed messages for them to return my imperative phone call. Additionally, on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX hours I sent a message via email from the XXXX XXXX to customer service and still have yet to receive any kind of response from any of the XXXX company or employees. At this point, I feel like I 've been taken advantage of financially, emotionally and physically, so let me explain why I 'm filing this complaint. It is unjust enrichment for large internet companies like XXXX and financial institutions like Bank of America to continue operating when offering false advertising of XXXX percent interest rates on purchases for extended months, XXXX percent balance transfers within a short time period, changes to terms and conditions without adhering to initial advertised rates, all while benefiting financially from the well-intended consumer. I 'm outraged at the hoops I 've had to jump through in an attempt to rectify this situation. As it stands, there has been no compensation to right this financial wrong by either company. I 'm accruing interest at an alarming rate, despite my great credit score, all while I 've had to seek out the solution independently because these big companies ca n't be honest, stick to their word, or remain transparent! I would have never signed up for a card knowing I 'd be charged high interest on purchases from day one. I did n't  really need another card because I already have multiple cards with low interest rates. The whole appeal of this BankAmericard was the offered 0 % Intro Purchase APR for 19 months! I 'm appalled to be told I have to work harder to find the solution to Bank of America 's mistake. I 've done everything that 's been asked of me and then more. I pay my bills on time, have great credit, live a deceit-free life and give generously to the world. Emotionally this experience has left me wanting to close all my credit cards, withdraw my money from every financial institution/investment and sue the pants off Bank of America and XXXX! I 'm not a XXXX consumer!!! I thoroughly investigated each credit offer and took all the appropriate steps before signing up for a new credit card. To be embroiled in falsified advertising makes me very angry and hate big business! Sadly, I was n't even respected enough as a consumer to be provided a return curtesy call, after multiple attempts, to rectify this unjust situation by XXXX. Then there 's the physical side to this nonsensical dishonesty ... I 'm XXXX from an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The fact that Bank of America required me to send documents and correspondence via fax ONLY, instead of allowing the ease and use of email is beyond me. All of these documents could have been sent promptly to BofA if they would have accepted an emailed version. It is n't an easy task for me to gather my personal/financial information, feel secure sending said information via random fax number, to said manager at BofA, then be turned down and told they could n't remedy their error with the information I worked so hard to gather. I 've had to physically travel to gather/send information causing great hardship to my already XXXX XXXX and the stress of the situation has also caused me to have an uptick in stress headaches. My hope is for the government, through whatever methods can be utilized and successful, stop companies like XXXX and Bank of America from falsely advertising rates, terms and conditions, penalize this atrocious behavior, right the wrong to the customer/consumer by reinstating initial offers, waive high interest credit card accruement to allow the consumer to regain financial independence and set an example for ethical business practices to ensure our economy will thrive. Please contact me if there are any further questions or details needed to ameliorate this complaint/process.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'xxxx', 'searched', 'best', 'credit',

1,8,30,35,"HELLO! I 'm disputing with Bank of america. When In XXXX in XXXX on XXXX i tried to put petrol at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Every XXXX has their own employees for putting some petrol and customer 's card processing purpose. At the time they took my credit card and inserted to their card processing device. But it was declined 5 times incluing my brothers credit card 3 times and mine 2 times. So finally ended up using my brothers debit card. After travel, i found out they charged me {$77.00} US dollar even though it was declined 5 times. I could n't use my credit card at all. I think this is definitely double charged and i have no reason to pay again. also i do n't get what based on they charged me XXXX I thought everything is going well because i have declined slips. But the problem has been started from here. My bank credit card claims department keep saying that i have to pay {$77.00} Because there was no credit card numbers, the amount to be credited and merchant name on the declined slips The credit card dept keep insisting that these are not vaild credit card slips. If these are not proper card slip, who gave me the credit card slips? I did n't get any valid slips from XXXX company. this is not my mistakes Do you know what even worse things? At the time putting the petrol, i did n't sign on the recepit at all but the petrol stn and bank of america  keep saying that i signed so i asked BOA to send me copy of my signature and they said already mailed me it was more than month ago and i called a few times the bank sent the mail for sure Everytime i called they said just wait but i think they are lying I have been spending huge amount of time to solve this problems and too much stress since XXXX I guess no one fight for this long. most of them would give up. But the credit card dept never change their stands. finally i have no choice but reach the XXXX head quarter to solve this terrible problem and i 'm still waiting So my suggestion is asking the Bank of america whether they sent mail or not I have no idea even they have my signature as proof of purchase If it turns out that the bank is lying there will be a huge problem of trust.

2,5,27,99,"This is a reply to Bank of America, NA 's ( BANA )  response to Complaint No. XXXX submitted by XXXX XXXX XXXX. When fraud on the court exists, the orders issued by those courts are void. The courts were lead to believe that BANA had standing to pursue this foreclosure based in part on an affidavit attested to by someone who obviously had no personal knowledge of the facts or actually reviewed the account record. Specifically, the affiant did not review the mortgage document that clearly defines when the loan becomes delinquent. Banks have been afforded far more deference by the courts than they deserve considering the industry was riddled with fraud at the height of the mortgage crisis. In fact, BANA signed a Consent Order drafted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) after an examination revealed flagrant abuses where affidavits were obviously signed by someone other than someone with personal knowledge or reviewed the facts. Similarly XXXX XXXX XXXX, who responded to this complaint, had no personal knowledge or provided no evidence that she reviewed the facts. She was the attorney of record but was not the litigating attorney. My records from the numerous proceedings indicate that she never opened any of the motions I filed with the XXXX County XXXX Circuit Court when the cases were opened. Someone with personal knowledge of the facts should have responded to this complaint. Anyone can get a copy of a docket sheet and summarize. BANA filed or caused to be filed in federal and state courts, an affidavit in which the affiant represents that the assertions in the affidavit was based on personal knowledge or review. Under Michigan law, affidavits recorded with the register of deeds may be received as evidence in any civil matter and serves as prima facie evidence of the facts ( MCL 565.453 ). Prima facie evidence is sufficient to raise a presumption unless disproved or disputed. Despite being rebutted, the court presumed it was an accurate accounting of the facts. The response to my complaint is inadequate and fails to explain issues that are at the heart of this dispute such as : 1 ) Why BANA believes the loan first became delinquent in XXXX 2012. 2 ) Why BANA believes they do not have to respond to my Qualified Written Request sent prior to the foreclosure.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['this', 'is', 'a', 'reply', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'na', 's', 'bana', 'response', 'to', 'complaint', 'no', 'xxxx', 'submitted', 'by', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'when', 'fraud', 'on', 'the', 'court', 'exists', 'the', 'orders', 'issued', 'by', 'those', 'courts', 'are', 'void', 'the', 'courts', 'were', 'lead', 'to', 'believe', 'that', 'bana', 'had', 'standing', 'to', 'pursue', 'this', 'foreclosure', 'based', 'in', 'part', 'on', 'an', 'affidavit', 'attested', 'to', 'by', 'someone', 'who', 'obviously', 'had', 'no', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'of', 'the', 'facts', 'or', 'actually', 'reviewed', 'the', 'account', 'record', 'specifically', 'the', 'affiant', 'did', 'not', 'review', 'the', 'mortgage', 'document', 'that', 'clearly', 'defines', 'when', 'the', 'loan', 'becomes', 'delinquent', 'banks', 'have', 'been', 'afforded', 'far', 'more', 'deference', 'by', 'the', 'courts', 'than', 'they', 'deserve', 'considering', 'the', 'industry', 'was', 'riddled', 'with', 'fraud', 'at', 'the', 'height', 'of', 'the', 'mortgage', 'crisis', 'in', 'fact', 'bana', 'signed', 'a', 'consent', 'order', 'drafted', 'by', 'the', 'office', 'of', 'the', 'comptroller', 'of', 'the', 'currency', 'occ', 'after', 'an', 'examination', 'revealed', 'flagrant', 'abuses', 'where', 'affidavits', 'were', 'obviously', 'signed', 'by', 'someone', 'other', 'than', 'someone', 'with', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'or', 'reviewed', 'the', 'facts', 'similarly', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'who', 'responded', 'to', 'this', 'complaint', 'had', 'no', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'or', 'provided', 'no', 'evidence', 'that', 'she', 'reviewed', 'the', 'facts', 'she', 'was', 'the', 'attorney', 'of', 'record', 'but', 'was', 'not', 'the', 'litigating', 'attorney', 'my', 'records', 'from', 'the', 'numerous', 'proceedings', 'indicate', 'that', 'she', 'never', 'opened', 'any', 'of', 'the', 'motions', 'i', 'filed', 'with', 'the', 'xxxx', 'county', 'xxxx', 'circuit', 'court', 'when', 'the', 'cases', 'were', 'opened', 'someone', 'with', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'of', 'the', 'facts', 'should', 'have', 'responded', 'to', 'this', 'complaint', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'a', 'copy', 'of', 'a', 'docket', 'sheet', 'and', 'summarize', 'bana', 'filed', 'or', 'caused', 'to', 'be', 'filed', 'in', 'federal', 'and', 'state', 'courts', 'an', 'affidavit', 'in', 'which', 'the', 'affiant', 'represents', 'that', 'the', 'assertions', 'in', 'the', 'affidavit', 'was', 'based', 'on', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'or', 'review', 'under', 'michigan', 'law', 'affidavits', 'recorded', 'with', 'the', 'register', 'of', 'deeds', 'may', 'be', 'received', 'as', 'evidence', 'in', 'any', 'civil', 'matter', 'and', 'serves', 'as', 'prima', 'facie', 'evidence', 'of', 'the', 'facts', 'mcl', 'five hundred and sixty-five thousand, four hundred and fifty-three', 'prima', 'facie', 'evidence', 'is', 'sufficient', 'to', 'raise', 'a', 'presumption', 'unless', 'disproved', 'or', 'disputed', 'despite', 'being', 'rebutted', 'the', 'court', 'presumed', 'it', 'was', 'an', 'accurate', 'accounting', 'of', 'the', 'facts', 'the', 'response', 'to', 'my', 'complaint', 'is', 'inadequate', 'and', 'fails', 'to', 'explain', 'issues', 'that', 'are', 'at', 'the', 'heart', 'of', 'this', 'dispute', 'such', 'as', 'one', 'why', 'bana', 'believes', 'the', 'loan', 'first', 'became', 'delinquent', 'in', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and twelve', 'two', 'why', 'bana', 'believes', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'to', 'respond', 'to', 'my', 'qualified', 'written', 'request', 'sent', 'prior', 'to', 'the', 'foreclosure']"

In an attempt to call them just to follow up, I looked up the creditor and called which only brought me to an automated system and directing me to voicemail each time. I looked up my bank information and tried calling the number associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX who collected from my account, the same issue.

1,8,12,26,"I used two balance transfer promotional offers from Bank of America, one that expired onXX/XX/XXXXand the other active until XX/XX/XXXX. On the first offer, I was charged an interest of {$60.00} on a remaining balance of {$3500.00} on my XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX statement ( APR = 20.74 % therefore, interest = 20.74/XXXX*30/365* {$3500.00} = {$60.00} ). I then made a payment of {$3600.00} onXX/XX/XXXX. Any payment in excess of the minimum monthly payment is supposed to go to the account with higher APR first. My total balance at this time was {$6900.00} and the minimum payment required was {$120.00}. I also made a purchase of {$240.00} in this billing cycle ( purchase APR = 17.74 % ). I was expecting the balance on my first balance transfer to be lowered by around $ 3600.00- {$120.00} = {$3400.00} which will make it $ XXXX- {$3400.00} = {$63.00} or somewhere around that going forward. However, my XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXXstatement shows this balance to be {$2300.00} and I was charged interest of {$41.00} on that ( 20.74/XXXX*31/365* {$2300.00} ). I believed this was an error and hoping that it will be rectified, I called the bank onXX/XX/XXXX. After longer than an hour on the phone and transferring between three customer service agents, all I got was that they basically admit that it is a mistake but were unable to correct it. One agent even mentioned the {$2300.00} is not a real balance, but it is a projection. However, the interest it accrued is added to my total balance of {$3600.00} ( {$6900.00} - {$3600.00} + {$240.00} + {$41.00} + {$1.00} ). You can also see that it is a bogus number because my total balance currently is {$3600.00} but the balances on the two balance transfer offers are written on my latest statement as {$2300.00} and {$3300.00}, which wo n't add up. The final agent mentioned the previous agent has tried to initiate a refund and she was not successful. Then he told me that I would get a detailed explanation of how I got charged the interest through mail with options to go forward. Today I received a letter datedXX/XX/XXXXfrom Bank of America and to my surprise, the letter stops mid sentence trying to explain the reason I was charged interest. This is appalling and it looked borderline fraudulent in all honesty. To make sure that the letter is indeed as it was, I called the bank again today and the first agent confirmed that it is sent from them. She in fact tried to tell me the reason I was charged interest and stopped midway. She said she was attempting to read me from the letter! Then she transferred me to another agent ( named XXXX ) and it was the same thing all over again. I asked the amount I needed to pay on the next payment date ( which is XX/XX/XXXX ) to avoid paying interest and the amounts I was told range from {$55.00} to {$3300.00} plus. All did n't make sense though because of the bogus calculation on my current statement that I explained above. I asked for an email address to address my concern further up but was told that I had to do that from my account but the online support is no longer available from there. And there is no way of contacting the bank by email in this day and age! Then I requested the agent to file a complaint/claim on my behalf or escalate my case to her superiors. After trying for a while, I was told that that was impossible too. I then indicated my intention to file a complaint but other than asking for apology, there is nothing that the agent was able to do to solve the issue. I am afraid that the bank will continue to charge me interest on non-existent balance whatever amount I pay next. Therefore, I am forced to file this complaint with the hope that I get a fair resolution. Please refer to my bank statements that I referred above and the letter I received today. Comparing the two statements clearly shows the glaring mistake that I tried my best to explain above.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'used', 'two', 'balance', 'transfer',

2,5,8,8,"Bank of America has committed gross violations of Title X of of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of XX/XX/XXXX ( the Act ) which established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and any and all referenced regulations and laws endorsed by this Act. The violations include as a minimum the following which are explicitly prohibited by the Act : unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices in connection with consumer products and services and various other consumer laws and implementing regulations as endorsed by the Act. The CFPB is requested to initiate legal proceedings against Bank of America for intentionally, knowingly, and willful violations of the Act. <P/>The following are a few of the acts committed by Bank of America, and there are others which should be addressed in the prosecution of Bank of America and this investigation. The consumer will provide these upon request. <P/>1. Bank of America deceptively, unfairly, and abusively attempted to collect and even reported to the CFPB that merchant service cancellation fees were due when in fact they were previously waived by the merchant, XXXX XXXX. <P/>2. Bank of America deceptively, unfairly, and abusively attempted to collect charges for XXXX XXXX Equipment which in fact had been previously returned to the Merchant, XXXX XXXX. <P/>3. Bank of America unfairly and abusively attempted to charge the credit account when in fact the credit account was previously closed and the merchant account was also previously closed. There was no remaining contractual relationship between the consumer, Bank of America, and XXXX XXXX. These are clearly invalid charges. <P/>4. Bank of America submitted a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX to CFPB with numerous items, many are meaningless facts with virtually no relevance to the matter at hand and they appear to be an attempt to misrepresent ( deception ) the situation, BUT Bank of America deceptively ( by omission ) omits numerous phone calls by the credit card holder to them describing the situation, the required action, the prohibited tasks, and numerous other facts related to the dispute. <P/>XXXX. Bank of America failed to exercise due diligence in investigating the dispute, and as a result they abused the consumer by filing false ( deceptive ) claims against the consumer 's credit records with the Credit Bureaus. Bank of America committed gross negligence in performing their responsibilities as required by the Act. <P/>6. Bank of America failed to review ( deception by omission ) the contracts and recognize that the actual contracts were not discernible as to the consumer responsibilities as a result of the way they were presented to consumer, signed by consumer, and executed. This is again a failure to do due diligence by Bank of America, and fails to meet requirements of the Act. <P/>7. Bank of America failed to recognize that there was NO CONTRACT or credit agreement open between consumer and Bank of America at the time the paid XXXX XXXX. Bank of America had NO contract with XXXX XXXX, and therefore they were not authorized in any way to pay funds on behalf of consumer. This is unfair and abusive per the Act. <P/>8. Bank of America 's letter dated XX/XX/XXXX was totally inadequate to justify their position and actions regarding payment to XXXX XXXX, reimbursement by consumer, and filing reports to the Credit Reporting Agencies. <P/>SUMMARY : Bank of America 's actions clearly show they have willfully, knowingly, and intentionally violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of XX/XX/XXXX( the Act ) in this matter. The violations include unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive actions which are explicitly prohibited by the Act. A formal enforcement investigation the CFPB is fully warranted and justified by Bank of America 's actions. T Consumers should be protected by such illegal behavior, and the full extent of the law and regulations should be used to demonstrate that not only is Bank of America not allowed to violate the law in this manner with no consequences, but no other credit or banking agencies should be allowed to perform these actions without being held accountable.. <P/>Regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX","BANK OF AMERICA,

To summarize, in this complaint, I documented numerous attempts prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to have BofA stop sending me marketing email, specifically marketing email pertaining to the BofA app. On XX/XX/XXXX, BofA responded and said, In consideration of your request, we have manually refused the option for the mobile application on your behalf on our system of record and this took place on XX/XX/XXXX, Please allow up to 48 business hours for the changes to be fully effective. In addition, please be advised we have recorded your request again to no longer receive solicitations from Bank of America. After their response to me on XX/XX/XXXX, I received another marketing email from BofA about the BofA app. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed another complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, complaint # XXXX. To summarize, in this complaint, I pointed out that BofA did not honor their commitment to me as stated in their response to me on XX/XX/XXXX - the commitment to discontinue sending me email pertaining to the BofA app. On XX/XX/XXXX, BofA responded and said, While our enclosed previous response confirmed that the Do Not Email privacy choice was previously captured twice, a third Do Not Email privacy choice request was captured on XX/XX/XXXX. All privacy choices are honored within 30 days, with the exception of Do Not Mail requests which could take up to 12 weeks. In their previous responses to me, BofA considers the endless marketing of the BofA app as being part of my account ( and part of my account agreement with them ), and thus not marketing. However, as BofA well knows, the BofA app merely functions as an add on product and/or service. A product/service that BofA is well aware I dont need and dont want.

1,8,30,22,"XX/XX/XXXX Bank of America Dispute Resolution Services Claim number # XXXX To CFPB I have some major concerns regarding the review and/or investigation conducted by Bank of America because a decision was made to close the claim based on evidence that you received from XXXX XXXX XXXX and not the consumer. The claim was filed XX/XX/XXXX and I received a temporary credit of {$4600.00} and again on XX/XX/XXXX. Im requesting additional investigating and in regard to resolving error of an unauthorized credit charge against my XXXX card. I have made several attempts to resolve this claim, however Bank of America indicated that they are siding with the merchant. I informed the representation at Bank of America that I didnt give permission for the merchant to credit my XXXX card for {$4600.00}. I also questioned if the merchant provided documentation with my authorization, however the representative stated that they dont care about the signature and I needed to get an Attorney. I have provided documentation to show that the parties in question charging my card without my authorization. XXXX XXXX provide documents that were altered and it was acceptable to Bank of America. Also, I provided a written contract with my signature, but I was informed by the representative that Bank of America doesnt review signatures because they are not liable for making sure signatures are valid on documents. The merchant submitted altered evidence that you are accepting as proof of wrongful doing. These facts should have been taken into consideration for the reasons listed below : A. The letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states that I provided information to your department to be reviewed by someone in dispute department, however the letter stated that have tried to work with the merchant to get the funds back, but all options have failed. I called Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them that they accepted alter documents and I provided some documentation including the official contract showing that I did not give them authorization to withdraw funds from my account. I indicated that I thought my funds were insured by FDIC and I was a victim of fraudulent activity. The representative stated that I would have to hire an Attorney to get my money back from the merchant. B. The letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX states that the temporary credit for {$4600.00} would be reversed based on evidence that you received from XXXX XXXX that were altered and changed. Two transactions were withheld from my checking account of {$950.00} and {$4600.00}. I gave authorization for {$950.00}, but I did not give authorization for XXXX to withdraw {$4600.00} from my checking account. C. I did not give XXXX XXXX permission to process charges on my debit card under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Therefore, this was an unauthorized purchase initiated by XXXX XXXX "" without actual authority to initiate such transfer. '' During a review of our Reg E dispute process handling failed and is in violation within the 45 day period. D. XXXX informed us that they would pack our furniture on XX/XX/XXXX and delivery the furniture to our new home on XX/XX/XXXX ; however, after the first day of the move, the company threatens to keep our furniture unless we paid additional money to get our furniture delivery at the date that was agreed in the contract. I refused to pay any additional funds, so they made a decision to move our furniture. Later, I found out that XXXX XXXX charged my card. I immediately filed a police report and a complaint with the Department of Transportation because I didnt agree to pay additional funds or sign another contract. E. The claim was filed on XX/XX/XXXX and investigated until XX/XX/XXXX, but my acknowledgement letter states that the investigation would take 45 days to complete which this dispute is violation of Regulation E. The letter was sent to the Merchant on XX/XX/XXXX which delayed the completion of the investigation. The bank should have investigated the unauthorized debit card charges within 10 days of receiving notification from me. Bank of America has determined to reclaim the money without a full investigation. F. The letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states that the charges were approved by the customer ; however, I never agreed or signed any documents giving XXXX XXXX authorization to withdraw {$4500.00} from my XXXX. Two transactions were posted to my account. I did agree to pay the down payment of {$950.00} and XXXX XXXX with my XXXX, however I did not authorize the second transaction. Im providing several emails from XXXX XXXX still requesting my authorization to use my debit/credit card that is still requesting currently. G. The letter dated XX/XX/XXXX is not the contract that I agreed upon and Im including a copy of the original contract that I agree upon with XXXX XXXX. The contract that you received from XXXX XXXX has been altered such as the total charges based on the prior estimate, the first line of the amount, the total estimated charges, and the shipper/agent/representative date has been altered, this is not my signature and I did not sign this document. The document that was received by XXXX is an estimate document and the numbers have been altered. I sent the original contract to Bank of America showing the agreed upon cost. H. The 2nd page of the bill of lading contract is a falsified document because I did not sign this document, nor did I agree to the amounts listed on the estimate document. I. The email document has also been altered because I didnt send an email or forward an email to XXXX agreeing to any of the terms listed within the contract that you received from XXXX XXXX. Also, has anyone noticed that some of the information has be redacted and written all over by someone at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX invoice is falsified document and the information was forged by the company because I did not agree in writing or verbally to pay {$15000.00} to this company, however I did agree to pay {$9500.00} to XXXX XXXX which is writing. The written contract shows the correct amount. K. Im not sure why Bank of America accepted the explanation from XXXX XXXX stating that services were handled at 100 % because I tried to resolve my dispute before filing a dispute, but the company would not apply a credit to my bank account. I have filed two police reports and filed a claim to the Motor of Transportation showing that we were taken advantage by XXXX XXXX XXXX and they should be held accountable and reported for the falsified information that they have submitted to your dispute department. There were unauthorized charges made with my debit card against my bank account and I shouldnt be held liable. Once the documents were reviewed that you received from XXXX as evidence ( Did you question why the amounts and dates were altered? Did you validate the signatures on the documents? Did you request documents from the consumer? Did you review the date the complaint was filed and verify if you were in compliance of Regulation E, and UDAPP? Did you verify consents in writing for credit card charges used with for the debit transactions against my bank account? I plan to file complaints against Bank of America to the following : Federal Trade Commission Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Another police report A complaint with Bank of America Remove all my funds from accounts at Bank of America File and disclose reputational risk You are in violation of Regulation E and Unfair Deceptive Acts and Practice ( UDAAP ) and keep the credit of {$4600.00} permanently.

On XXXX XXXX 2017 the account was still overdrawn for that amount when I came in as I always do to cash my paycheck of {$710.00}, expecting to pay off the negative balance and take the rest out in cash, but the representative told me she would be unable to cash my check. I explained that this is unusual and asked why and she replied that it was the system not allowing me to cash the check. The best she could do was give me {$200.00} of my check. I said no thank you I will go cash it else where out of frustration for no being able to have access to my money as I needed the funds so I choose to the other local branch just down the street.Unfortunately it was just closing but I had the opportunity to speak with a representative who said the end of the business day was XXXX XXXX for those ATM at the branch, so if I did not want to incur an other {$35.00} extended overdraft fee I could still deposit my paycheck which was important to me as well.

When went online to get a better idea of what was going on since the receipt would not show my available balance and why the bank held funds that are usually treated as cash I found nothing to justify it. The only transactions at the time was the same as it I was required to pay as I did on the XXXX of XXXX 2017, and could have been deducted immediately after deposit my check via ATM or even by phone as long as it was before XXXX that day. My online Bank of America account stated on XXXX XXXX 2017 a deposit for {$710.00} was made of which {$300.00} was availble now and {$410.00} was being held as credit pending to cover items posted on the XXXX XXXX 2017. The account reflected a {$300.00} credit to my account which should have been avail now and was not. I believe I should have been able to cash my paycheck as always. After bringing the account out of negative status should I have received the remaining portion of my check ( {$490.00} ) if there was nothing else that could have been pending at that time as there was no existing transactions or any type of authorizations from the time of the overdraft date and had no reason to prompt such a hold.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['my', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'account', 'was', 'charged', 'a', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'fee', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'for', 'an', 'overdraft', 'of', 'seventeen thousand', 'on', 'the', 'same', 'date', 'which', 'brought', 'my', 'account', 'to', 'a', 'negative', 'balance', 'of', 'twenty-one thousand', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'the', 'account', 'was', 'still', 'overdrawn', 'for', 'that', 'amount', 'when', 'i', 'came', 'in', 'as', 'i', 'always', 'do', 'to', 'cash', 'my', 'paycheck', 'of', 'seventy-one thousand', 'expecting', 'to', 'pay', 'off', 'the', 'negative', 'balance', 'and', 'take', 'the', 'rest', 'out', 'in', 'cash', 'but', 'the', 'representative', 'told', 'me', 'she', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'to', 'cash', 'my', 'check', 'i', 'explained', 'that', 'this', 'is', 'unusual', 'and', 'asked', 'why', 'and', 'she', 'replied', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'the', 'system', 'not', 'allowing', 'me', 'to', 'cash', 'the', 'check', 'the', 'best', 'she', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'give', 'me', 'twenty thousand', 'of', 'my', 'check', 'i', 'said', 'no', 'thank', 'you', 'i', 'will', 'go', 'cash', 'it', 'else', 'where', 'out', 'of', 'frustration', 'for', 'no', 'being', 'able', 'to', 'have', 'access', 'to', 'my', 'money', 'as', 'i', 'needed', 'the', 'funds', 'so', 'i', 'choose', 'to', 'the', 'other', 'local', 'branch', 'just', 'down', 'the', 'streetunfortunately', 'it', 'was', 'just', 'closing', 'but', 'i', 'had', 'the', 'opportunity', 'to', 'speak', 'with', 'a', 'representative', 'who', 'said', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'the', 'business', 'day', 'was', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'for', 'those', 'atm', 'at', 'the', 'branch', 'so', 'if', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'to', 'incur', 'an', 'other', 'three thousand, five hundred', 'extended', 'overdraft', 'fee', 'i', 'could', 'still', 'deposit', 'my', 'paycheck', 'which', 'was', 'important', 'to', 'me', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'i', 'chose', 'to', 'deposit', 'the', 'check', 'and', 'had', 'then', 'expected', 'to', 'be', 'allowed', 'to', 'use', 'twenty thousand', 'of', 'my', 'check', 'deposit', 'and', 'instead', 'falsely', 'stated', 'i', 'had', 'thirty thousand', 'available', 'now', 'of', 'which', 'six thousand', 'was', 'the', 'only', 'amount', 'i', 'managed', 'to', 'withdraw', 'when', 'went', 'online', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'better', 'idea', 'of', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on', 'since', 'the', 'receipt', 'would', 'not', 'show', 'my', 'available', 'balance', 'and', 'why', 'the', 'bank', 'held', 'funds', 'that', 'are', 'usually', 'treated', 'as', 'cash', 'i', 'found', 'nothing', 'to', 'justify', 'it', 'the', 'only', 'transactions', 'at', 'the', 'time', 'was', 'the', 'same', 'as', 'it', 'i', 'was', 'required', 'to', 'pay', 'as', 'i', 'did', 'on', 'the', 'xxxx', 'of', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'and', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deducted', 'immediately', 'after', 'deposit', 'my', 'check', 'via', 'atm', 'or', 'even', 'by', 'phone', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'it', 'was', 'before', 'xxxx', 'that', 'day', 'my', 'online', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'account', 'stated', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'a', 'deposit', 'for', 'seventy-one thousand', 'was', 'made', 'of', 'which', 'thirty thousand', 'was', 'availble', 'now', 'and', 'forty-one thousand', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'as', 'credit', 'pending', 'to', 'cover', 'items', 'posted', 'on', 'the', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'the', 'account', 'reflected', 'a', 'thirty thousand', 'credit', 'to', 'my', 'account', 'which', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'avail', 'now', 'and', 'was', 'not', 'i', 'believe', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'to', 'cash', 'my', 'paycheck', 'as', 'always', 'after', 'bringing', 'the', 'account', 'out', 'of', 'negative', 'status', 'should', 'i', 'have', 'received', 'the', 'remaining', 'portion', 'of', 'my', 'check', 'forty-nine thousand', 'if', 'there', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'that', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pending', 'at', 'that', 'time', 'as', 'there', 'was', 'no', 'existing', 'transactions', 'or', 'any', 'type', 'of', 'authorizations', 'from', 'the', 'time', 'of', 'the', 'overdraft', 'date', 'and', 'had', 'no', 'reason', 'to', 'prompt', 'such', 'a', 'hold']"

0,2,20,82,"Around XXXX XXXX, 2013, I checked my accounts with Bank of America like I have done every morning. I had a joint checking acct with my son who was in college in XXXX at the time. The normal acct balance has always been low, since I was only able to afford to send him low amounts of money at a time. This morning when I checked the account, the balance was - {$880000.00}. I was shocked. I checked the transactions and they claimed that {$1500.00} was deposited early that morning, but they were a bunch of deductions taken. There was also a purchase of items over {$600.00} at a Rite Aid. All this happened in New York between the hours of XXXX - XXXX. I live in XXXX  and my son attends school in XXXX. I called BOA immediately to report there was some fraud going on. They took my information and I asked them to check the ATM to see who the person was that made the deposit and withdrawals. They deposited fake Money order and took out real money. I do n't know how they were able to do this. I had n't even has so much as a bounced check with them. I found that it was fraud through my son. They first cleaned out my checking and savings accounts and left me {$20.00}. I called and asked why did they take my money when I was the one who called and reported it. They told me "" well as least we left you {$20.00} for gas. '' I was shocked they did that so fast without even investigating. Well, shortly after I completed all the necessary paperwork, they quickly send me a letter saying they did not believe that we did n't have anything to do with this. I thought the fraud department was suppose to investigate this. They place this on my record with XXXX XXXX even though I had absolutely nothing to do with this.

0,2,20,47,"Last Friday ( X/XX/2017 ) I went to a Bank of America located in XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida. I asked to withdraw XXXX to make a purchase from a private party and the teller told me that I could only withdraw XXXX. I had over XXXX in my checking account. I let the teller know I 'm actually a Vice President for Bank of America and I 've never heard of such a policy. <P/>I would not keep so much cash on deposit at Bank of America if I knew that I could n't get it out when I need it. Someone brought me into a Merrill Lynch marked office after the teller said he 'd get someone to help me. I 'm a ML client so I was hopeful that the Financial Advisor would be able to help me but it turned out that I was talking to the Branch Manager who was illegally working out of a Merrill Lynch office which is clearly against Bank policy. <P/>The Branch Manager "" XXXX XXXX '' told me he could only let me withdraw XXXX. I ask him to give me an explanation of why I can not withdraw my own money and he told me since I work for Bank of America I should know what the policy is. I vehemently protested to the idea of limiting my teller withdrawals and if this was the case it would need to be disclosed properly to the consumer. <P/>I asked to see this supposed policy in writing and the Branch Manager refused to show me anything in writing. I let him know that this was a major offense and a breach of contract that I do not take lightly. I asked him how to submit a formal complaint against him and once again he tells me that since I work for the Bank that I should know how to complian against him. <P/>I ended up withdrawing XXXX since I had no choice and I immediately called the Bank HR department to complain. Bank HR forwarded my call to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who they claim is an independent 3rd party. I have good reason to believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is actually a associate for hire that is paid to hide and even to suppress complaints. It has been 3 business days and I have still not heard back from either Bank of America or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. <P/>I have been on a medical leave of absence for a few months and prior to going on leave I tried to report several compliance violations that I 've witnessed while working for Bank of America. I was treated very rudely by a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Supervisor and I luckily have a recording of the whole 3 1/2 hour phone call since the first Rep. I talked to gave me her permission to record. <P/>At this point I have no choice but to seek legal action on behalf of all the other employees and consumers that are being wronged by Bank of America. I would like to hear from someone in your organization to discuss these matters in greater detail.

XXXX accept my asking that she would handle that should be sent via XXXX. To confirm the process, the call was transferred to a XXXX translator of the XXXX?, she was so rude.

I also got a mail saying the case was closed with the number. Unfortunately, I have not yet received the check via XXXX. It may not a big money to the company, but it is a big money to me now. Whenever I call to BOA customer 's service, It is very hard to talk with because my account has already been closed.

3,13,2,44,"In year XXXX I bought an investment property located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas XXXX. There were two mortgages, one  {$80000.00} and the second {$15000.00} both financed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Total {$95000.00} with a down-payment of {$6000.00} +.
<P/>
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was then bought by Bank of America. In XXXX, I became sick with XXXX XXXX and still is till today, on XXXX. Due to my illness, I could n't go to the property to collect mails or rent the place. Two months into a foreclosure process in XXXX, Bank of America foreclosed on my property for FULL price. I called when I discovered that the house was foreclosed. Bank of America told me that FULL price was paid by XXXX XXXX who bought it and that I do not owe Bank of America any amount on the two mortgages. My three-bureaus credit reports started to reflect XXXX balance on both accounts.
<P/>
Then in XXXX, a company called XXXXl, located in XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Texas, XXXX started to call and write to me that I owe them {$15000.00} second  mortgage. Tel : XXXX.
<P/>
First, their letter stated that I owed XXXX XXXX XXXX, however, a note they called Alonge-to-note claims that they bought the second mortgage from Bank of America.
<P/>
I tried to obtain evidence of sale from Bank of America, BAC but BAC kept telling me that I do not owe them and that I should talk to their attorney because the file has been closed long time ago. Their attorney meanwhile said that only BAC can provide me the evidence of foreclosure sales I needed.
<P/>
XXXX then took me to court. To summarize, I was ill and couldnt appear in court the first time. I wrote to the judge with my complaints. The judge ruled against me WITHOUT EVIDENCE.
<P/>
The I went to the court the second time to see the judge who thought I lived in XXXX, Virginia whereas I live in XXXX, Texas near XXXX where his court is located.
<P/>
After passing judgment without evidence, he advised me to go to XXXX County to obtain the original sale papers and the Foreclosure sale papers. That I should compare the two to see what is owed.
<P/>
I did. Both papers show and proved what BAC said that I owe them nothing. However, the judge did not rescind in his judgement. He said I should go and get a lawyer to appeal it. I am on XXXX  and could not afford a lawyer.
<P/>
XXXX XXXX has been harassing me since then and accruing interest on the {$15000.00} which they now calculate to be {$19000.00}.
<P/>
PLEASE RESCURE ME FROM XXXX. I DO NOT OWE THIS COMPANY A PENNY.

I manage the finances of my former husband, who has a XXXX XXXX My name has been added to his checking account.

<P/>
Their answering message notes that this is the day after a holiday and there may be long waits on this line. Why, with a company with as much money as BOA, did they not then add staff to handle expected excess calls? People need work. They could fill extra positions with OT, per diem, or regular part time help, if that is the flexibility the bank feels it needs.
<P/>
Today is not particularly unusual. I routinely wait at least 15 minutes for anyone at BOA to pick up.

It 's frankly abusive that a huge multinational corporation refuses to staff adequately in order to be minimally responsive to depositors. I have work responsibilities. I am also a XXXX XXXX. I started my work day two hours early today ( and what a blessing, that my current job allows me this flexibility ), in order to be available to take my former husband to two medical appointments later this afternoon. And yet BOA thinks it 's just fine to keep their staff numbers low and leave it to me, the consumer, to pay with MY time in order to ask them a question that is specific to our account and is not answered in their online FAQs.

1,8,12,85,"XX/XX/XXXX I call Bank of America- Merrill Lynch for information on my balance owed on my VISA Signature ( Merrill+ ) credit card. The automated service quotes me a current balance on my account : {$1800.00}. So I intended to make a phone payment of {$1800.00}. When I chose the option to make a payment, the automated service quotes me the amount of {$1900.00}. This amount was not current but based off the statement datedXX/XX/XXXXXXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I received a credit from a merchant : XXXX for {$42.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and another credit from them for {$7.00} on XX/XX/XXXX that was yet to be reflected in my statement for the following month. I was informed by Bank of America, I would receive a finance charge if I only paid the {$1800.00}, which would have brought my account to a {$0.00} balance. I had a {$0.00} balance on the previous statement. So, essentially, I would have to pay more than my current balance and have a credit of {$50.00} on my account to avoid a finance charge, even though that amount has already been credited on my account. If credits affect my current balance, then I should not be paying finance charges for bringing my balance to a {$0.00} balance. I was told by XXXX, a supervisor that Bank of America does not acknowledge credits to the account even if they are reflected in the current balance. Bank of America is misleading their customers by having their automated system state a customer 's current balance without a disclaimer stating that the full amount of the statement must be paid even if there has been a credit on the account. This racks up huge interest charges for Bank of America because the automated message regarding account balance potentially presents two different balances without explanation or instruction. What if I had bought a large item like a boat for {$5000.00} with my Visa, returned the boat due to faulty mechanism, the {$5000.00} credited to my Visa account within two days after the statement. Would I then need to pay {$5000.00} toward my now current balance of {$0.00} to avoid a 10.00 APR interest fee on my account? This is fraudulent and misleading. What right minded person would pay more than they owe when the balance is {$0.00}? Bank of America-Merrill Lynch is scooping up the millions in interest fees because they have mislead their customers to think they should make a payment based upon their current balance. Bank of America- Merrill Lynch is capitalizing on their automated services to keep customers from knowing what would keep them from paying unnecessary interest fees.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'call', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'merrill', 'lynch', 'for', 'information', 'on', 'my', 'balance', 'owed', 'on', 'my', 'visa', 'signature', 'merrill', 'credit', 'card', 'the', 'automated', 'service', 'quotes', 'me', 'a', 'current', 'balance', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'one hundred and eighty thousand', 'so', 'i', 'intended', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'phone', 'payment', 'of', 'one hundred and eighty thousand', 'when', 'i', 'chose', 'the', 'option', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'payment', 'the', 'automated', 'service', 'quotes', 'me', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'one hundred and ninety thousand', 'this', 'amount', 'was', 'not', 'current', 'but', 'based', 'off', 'the', 'statement', 'datedxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', 'i', 'received', 'a', 'credit', 'from', 'a', 'merchant', 'xxxx', 'for', 'four thousand, two hundred', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'and', 'another', 'credit', 'from', 'them', 'for', 'seven hundred', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'that', 'was', 'yet', 'to', 'be', 'reflected', 'in', 'my', 'statement', 'for', 'the', 'following', 'month', 'i', 'was', 'informed', 'by', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'i', 'would', 'receive', 'a', 'finance', 'charge', 'if', 'i', 'only', 'paid', 'the', 'one hundred and eighty thousand', 'which', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'my', 'account', 'to', 'a', 'zero', 'balance', 'i', 'had', 'a', 'zero', 'balance', 'on', 'the', 'previous', 'statement', 'so', 'essentially', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'to', 'pay', 'more', 'than', 'my', 'current', 'balance', 'and', 'have', 'a', 'credit', 'of', 'five thousand', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'to', 'avoid', 'a', 'finance', 'charge', 'even', 'though', 'that', 'amount', 'has', 'already', 'been', 'credited', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'if', 'credits', 'affect', 'my', 'current', 'balance', 'then', 'i', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'paying', 'finance', 'charges', 'for', 'bringing', 'my', 'balance', 'to', 'a', 'zero', 'balance', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'by', 'xxxx', 'a', 'supervisor', 'that', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'does', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'credits', 'to', 'the', 'account', 'even', 'if', 'they', 'are', 'reflected', 'in', 'the', 'current', 'balance', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'is', 'misleading', 'their', 'customers', 'by', 'having', 'their', 'automated', 'system', 'state', 'a', 'customer', 's', 'current', 'balance', 'without', 'a', 'disclaimer', 'stating', 'that', 'the', 'full', 'amount', 'of', 'the', 'statement', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'even', 'if', 'there', 'has', 'been', 'a', 'credit', 'on', 'the', 'account', 'this', 'racks', 'up', 'huge', 'interest', 'charges', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'because', 'the', 'automated', 'message', 'regarding', 'account', 'balance', 'potentially', 'presents', 'two', 'different', 'balances', 'without', 'explanation', 'or', 'instruction', 'what', 'if', 'i', 'had', 'bought', 'a', 'large', 'item', 'like', 'a', 'boat', 'for', 'five hundred thousand', 'with', 'my', 'visa', 'returned', 'the', 'boat', 'due', 'to', 'faulty', 'mechanism', 'the', 'five hundred thousand', 'credited', 'to', 'my', 'visa', 'account', 'within', 'two', 'days', 'after', 'the', 'statement', 'would', 'i', 'then', 'need', 'to', 'pay', 'five hundred thousand', 'toward', 'my', 'now', 'current', 'balance', 'of', 'zero', 'to', 'avoid', 'a', 'one thousand', 'apr', 'interest', 'fee', 'on', 'my', 'account', 'this', 'is', 'fraudulent', 'and', 'misleading', 'what', 'right', 'minded', 'person', 'would', 'pay', 'more', 'than', 'they', 'owe', 'when', 'the', 'balance', 'is', 'zero', 'bank', 'of', 'americamerrill', 'lynch', 'is', 'scooping', 'up', 'the', 'millions', 'in', 'interest', 'fees', 'because', 'they', 'have', 'mislead', 'their', 'customers', 'to', 'think', 'they', 'should', 'make', 'a', 'payment', 'based', 'upon', 'their', 'current', 'balance', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'merrill', 'lynch', 'is', 'capitalizing', 'on', 'their', 'automated', 'services', 'to', 'keep', 'customers', 'from', 'knowing', 'what', 'would', 'keep', 'them', 'from', 'paying', 'unnecessary', 'interest', 'fees']"

The last charge I made that night was at XX/XX/XXXX at XX/XX/XXXX for {$44.00} - but after leaving the bar I noticed my phone and wallet were missing from my pockets. My best guess is as the venue was crowded with many people close to each other that I was pick-pocketed. I walked home ( I live nearby ) and immediately messaged my friends. First thing the following morning ( still Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX ) I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX when they opened. I called my dad from the store phone to ask him to block my stolen cards, then I spoke with a customer representative to buy a new phone because I had received an alert that XXXX XXXX XXXX had been disabled ( screenshot attached ) - so I knew it was taken as they blocked me from finding it. Once I had my new phone I immediately called Bank of America to report everything and let them know of the fraudulent activity. We went through each transaction and I noted when the fraudulent transactions began - first with a {$500.00} cash withdrawal in XXXX XXXX and then another {$300.00} cash withdrawal in the same area. There were also internal transfers made - specifically the majority of my savings account was moved to my checking account. There was then a fraudulent charge made at XXXX 's for {$1000.00}. The customer rep at BOA noted this and opened two claims. Within a few days I was granted a temporary credit for one of the claims and {$1000.00} was stored into my account. ***Please note I also made a report with the XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's department and provided this information to BOA*** Today, Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX I  received an email from BOA that they will NOT be reimbursing me for my losses and they concluded the fraudulent charges "" were not made in error '' as stated in the attached letters. Also stated is the temporary credit of {$1000.00} will be reversed from my account on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX.

1,8,5,28,"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 12 years and I have 2 credit card accounts established with them as well as 3 other personal banking accounts. One credit card has been active since XX/XX/XXXX and the other since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never been late with a payment, I consistently make payments in excess of the minimum monthly payment due, and neither card is at its credit limit. I received a letter this weekend indicating that my accounts were closed permanently and I needed to update any information that was associated with those accounts. The reason given was that my risk profile had changed and did not align with their risk tolerance. The only thing that has changed about my risk profile is that another unrelated credit card account that had no balance- was compromised due to fraud. I was made aware of this by checking my credit report at which time I contacted my credit card company since they had charged late fees and reported the account as delinquent based on the fraudulent charges. The investigation has been completed, the charges and late fees and credit reporting have been removed/reversed. Bank of America made no attempt to call me to make any inquiry or even inform me about the account- they just closed and I was embarrassed at two merchants because the card was declined before I had knowledge of the account closure.

0,2,20,47,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017, I brought a XXXX check drawn on XXXX XXXX ( in XXXX ) to Bank of America 's branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. The value of the check was XXXX XXXX dollars ( which is approximately 15,000 US dollars ). The bank teller told me that the check would be sent to their collection department, and that the collection process would take 4 to 6 weeks or more. He had me sign a form for agreeing on the collection process. No balance was added to my checking account. <P/><P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 92 days from XX/XX/XXXX ), I heard nothing from Bank of America, despite that it had been already more than 12 weeks since I brought in the check. So, I visited the above-mentioned branch to ask why my account had not been credited for the check. A bank employee, XXXX XXXX XXXX, told me that she did not know what was going on. She mentioned that she could reach the collection department only via email, so that it would take a few days for her to get the necessary information. She promised to call me within 5 business days. In this visit, I showed a copy of the check, which I received from the bank on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX made a copy of the copy for their record. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 103 days ), I visited the branch again, because XXXX XXXX had not contacted me despite her promise. She had me wait quite a bit and spent much time claiming that she did nothing wrong. Also, she insisted that a collection process could take this much time, and that it could even take six months in some cases. Somehow, however, she escalated my case and promised to call me by the end of the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 104 days ), XXXX XXXX failed to call me again. Feeling that the bank was not working hard to resolve the problem, I called XXXX XXXX ( on whom the check is drawn ) to see the status of the check. They told me that they had seen neither a sign of the check clearing nor contact from Bank of America. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 107 days ), XXXX XXXX XXXX, a manager of the branch called me saying that he mentioned that the bank was willing to make an offer, given the delayed collection process. He told me that I could choose one of the two options. The first option was that I could continue to wait for another 4 to 8 weeks until the check clears. ( I did not understand why it was an offer, though. ) The second option was that I could have XXXX XXXX cancel the check and wire-transfer the money to myself, where all necessary fees would paid by Bank of America. I naturally accepted the second option. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 109 days ), I called XXXX XXXX. ( I could not do it earlier, due to the long XXXX weekend. ) XXXX XXXX told me two things. First, they could not cancel the check, because their system rejected the cancellation request. Second and more importantly, XXXX XXXX 's company rules do not allow them to wire-transfer funds to any bank outside XXXX. I told XXXX XXXX of Bank of America that his proposed resolution did not work. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 113 days ), XXXX XXXX called me, saying that a team of over twenty people was now working on my case at Bank of America and had found that the check had been lost. He mentioned that the bank could clear the lost check using the copy of the check XXXX XXXX made from mine on XX/XX/XXXX, if I give XXXX XXXX a permission to clear the check using the copy. He told me to contact a person at TD Securities by email. I emailed her accordingly. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 114 days ), the person at XXXX XXXX replied to me saying that my involvement in the clearing process would be unnecessary. She also mentioned that she had already told a staff at Bank of America how to clear the check by using the copy of the check. I passed this information to XXXX XXXX by email. I also urged him to release the funds to my checking account, given that the error was on their side, and the funds had been already held for 114 days. <P/><P/>As of XXXX XXXX, 2017 ( 118 days ), I have not heard back from Bank of America. I have no idea when my money will be put in my checking account.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'i', 'brought', 'a', 'xxxx', 'check',

1,8,12,85,"This is a serious problem~ regarding Bank of America 's Faulty & Misleading Accounting System across the board for all my 3 checking accounts with this bank, when using my Debit Card linked to any of my given BOA checking bank accounts. Here is the problem : When I use any of my debit cards to pay for a transaction, and the charge is, of course, immediately placed against my respective bank checking account to which it is linked, there is NO transaction number that Bank of America assigns to that transaction! SO I ca n't keep track of it! ~ or ANY of my transactions, so that I never know what my day-to-day ACCURATE balance really is in my accounts. What often happens is that even though the merchant has not actually claimed for that amount of money~ yet~ Bank of America deducts the amount of that charge from my respective bank account, and IF the merchant does n't really ask or claim for that amount of money IN 5 DAYS, Bank of America deletes it from its Telephone Banking System. And this same item that had shown up in my online banking account page, showing as still "" processing '', has no Transaction Number assigned to it, but this amount is ADDED BACK INTO my bank account, AS IF THIS transaction had never taken place~ leading me to believe that I have more money in my balance than I really do! ~ because BOA knows that this merchant will rightfully come back at some future time and really claim for their money ( unless the bank puts it into a Claims Dispute, which has not happened to these charges, & BOA knows this ). THEN in either 3 or 6 or 10 or 12 days, when this same merchant decides to really claim for its money ( the charge I had made ), this merchant goes back to Bank of America & THIS TIME actually withdraws the money from my account, which then is reflected in my balance, of course. Again! SO BOA 's system of deducting, then adding back into my bank account in 5 days if the merchant has n't truly claimed for its money, then deducting same again in 6 or 10 days, is VERY misleading! Another PROBLEM associated with BOA 's accounting system is that, as I pointed out to a phone BOA teller this past Friday ( XXXX XXXX 2017 ), there is a duplication of this same transaction that then shows up on my online bank account balance page, where he could see that this charge is showing as "" processing '' which has NO transaction #, and yet at same time, it is showing on same page that it has been paid in actuality at some later time~ all of which is reflected in the current "" Available Balance ''. The problem here is that NO one could keep track of his or her account balance at BOA with this kind of misleading system & information! Hence, I have had multiple, multiple {$35.00} overdraft fees on all my 3 bank accounts with BOA, and while BOA has refunded some of them, many have NOT been refunded, and I have lost a tremendous amount of money because of this problem. I have repeatedly asked Bank of America to give us an ACCURATE balance on both its online and telephone banking system, and the various tellers & supervisors have said they think I have a good idea, and will "" pass it along '' to whom (? ) at BOA, but nothing is ever done about it! Bank of America has tried to tell me also that it is up to the merchant ( to whom I paid a charge for a service, or made a payment ) to provide a transaction number to the bank, but regardless of whether a merchant does this, BOA SHOULD provide US, their customers, a tracking number, because it is on ITS OWN WEBSITE, WHICH THEY DO HAVE CONTROL OVER! But BOA denies any responsibility for this! I have told BOA that regardless of what a merchant does, it is incumbent upon BOA, as OUR bank, to give us a transaction number, so that we can keep track of it, until it is finally paid! Otherwise, I am always on shifting ground, like quick-sand, with BOA 's flimsy & misleading accounting, whereby they deduct such a charge, which has not really been withdrawn YET, then when a merchant has n't claimed for its money in just 5 Days, BOA puts back into our account that money, & then when merchant decides in about a week later to claim for that money, the money is suddenly withdrawn again, and this time, legitimately, without any prior warning to me ( because by that time, BOA has wiped it off my telephone account balance system, and as to BOA 's online system, as mentioned above, the same transaction has been assigned NO transaction number whereby I can see IF it has been paid, and when ), the bottom in my bank account drops out, and I am charged {$35.00} overdraft fees! THIS is LUDICROUS! WHAT a slick system BOA is operating! ~ VERY clever on their part, as a way to scam its customers out of money with these MULTITUDINOUS {$35.00} overdraft fees assessed on millions of customers at BOA! ~ because of its fraudulent, misleading accounting system which gives us defective, inaccurate, & incomplete information! BOA is and can get rich collecting ALL these {$35.00} overdraft fees, when you consider how many transactions I do every week, PLUS if you multiply that TIMES the number of OTHER BOA customers who also have to put up with such a fraudulent accounting system! I am asking that BOA would refund all my {$35.00} overdraft fees, and until BOA will change its online & telephone bank account systems to provide customers with complete & accurate information on each & every transaction, I will not do any more business there. I have repeatedly asked BOA to have a feature on its telephone system, in which we would be able to dial a number on our phone for our actual true balance, where all my transactions have CLEARED my bank account, and then we can dial another number on our phone to get a list of all the PROCESSING or "" waiting in the wings to be paid '' charges, which would have a Transaction Number for each of them, which we could add up and KNOW to deduct from our actual true balance given on the other phone button. THIS is what I used to be able to do at XXXX XXXX ( I no longer bank there ). BOA just says that 's a good idea & then never does anything about it!!! Consequently, I have been caught in this misleading type of bank accounting system of BOA 's, to where I 've had to pay all these crazy {$35.00} overdraft fees!, which have caused me to go broke! On top of that, when I spoke with that telephone bank teller at BOA on Friday, XXXX XXXX, he was going to have a supervisor to call me back, to place a hold on my {$35.00} overdraft fees accrued on that & previous day, but NO one at BOA called me back, and even on Monday, after I 'd put more money into my accounts over the weekend, when their business dept is closed, so that I could cover for these {$35.00} charges coming in, I never got a call back, so I called BOA AGAIN on Monday to request for a Supervisor to call me back, but no one ever did. SO THEN I called at XXXX XXXX later that day, holding on phone for ONE HOUR to speak with one finally, and she said she was n't going to refund any of my {$35.00} overdraft fees. THAT is when I decided to contact CFPB, to see if you could intervene on my behalf, and ask them to refund all my {$35.00} overdraft fees, given their faulty & misleading bank accounting in which it is impossible for anyone to keep an accurate balance in our bank accounts, without having any transaction number assigned by BOA to each transaction, using our debit card~ plus the other problems with their balance system as described above. IF you need further information about this, please contact me at Cell XXXX. Thank you for helping me on this. I ca n't help but think many other BOA customers suffer under similar fraudulent & misleading accounting at BOA.

1,8,25,80,"I have a credit card with Bank of America and have used promotional offers for balance transfers from credit cards. This is what they offer : "" A balance transfer has several benefits, including : Saving you money on interest and monthly charges Consolidating debt, which may help you pay it off faster One statement with one payment due each month '' So, I thought that if I paid my statement in full I will pay my purchases and the balance transfer, because they said "" one payment due each month ''. So I made a full payment of my balance on time, before the due date and I was charged interest, also, they said I still owe {$260.00} from my balance transfers. They do n't show the remaining balance related to balance transfers on their statements nor their website in their online bank, so there is no way for me to check what they are seeing or to check how much I have paid and how much I still owe. This is really a problem, because I do n't know if there is a mistake or not, if they are overcharging me or if what they say I owe is true or not. I do n't like to be late in my payments and I really do n't feel that the bank is being honest with me. 
It seems they apply my payments in the amount I owe from the statement, plus from the current purchases, but it is not clear how much they are applying to the remaining balance from my transfers I can show you my last statement if you need to see it. In my previous statement the total balance was XXXX and that 's what I paid and now they say I still owe {$260.00} due to the balance transfer. In the page where they post the Interest Charge Calculation, the balances there go up or down every month, even if I do n't do any new balance transfers and that is very confusing.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'have', 'a', 'credit', 'card', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'have', 'used', 'promotional', 'offers', 'for', 'balance', 'transfers', 'from', 'credit', 'cards', 'this', 'is', 'what', 'they', 'offer', 'a', 'balance', 'transfer', 'has', 'several', 'benefits', 'including', 'saving', 'you', 'money', 'on', 'interest', 'and', 'monthly', 'charges', 'consolidating', 'debt', 'which', 'may', 'help', 'you', 'pay', 'it', 'off', 'faster', 'one', 'statement', 'with', 'one', 'payment', 'due', 'each', 'month', 'so', 'i', 'thought', 'that', 'if', 'i', 'paid', 'my', 'statement', 'in', 'full', 'i', 'will', 'pay', 'my', 'purchases', 'and', 'the', 'balance', 'transfer', 'because', 'they', 'said', 'one', 'payment', 'due', 'each', 'month', 'so', 'i', 'made', 'a', 'full', 'payment', 'of', 'my', 'balance', 'on', 'time', 'before', 'the', 'due', 'date', 'and', 'i', 'was', 'charged', 'interest', 'also', 'they', 'said', 'i', 'still', 'owe', 'twenty-six thousand', 'from', 'my', 'balance', 'transfers', 'they', 'do', 'nt', 'show', 'the', 'remaining', 'balance', 'related', 'to', 'balance', 'transfers', 'on', 'their', 'statements', 'nor', 'their', 'website', 'in', 'their', 'online', 'bank', 'so', 'there', 'is', 'no', 'way', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'check', 'what', 'they', 'are', 'seeing', 'or', 'to', 'check', 'how', 'much', 'i', 'have', 'paid', 'and', 'how', 'much', 'i', 'still', 'owe', 'this', 'is', 'really', 'a', 'problem', 'because', 'i', 'do', 'nt', 'know', 'if', 'there', 'is', 'a', 'mistake', 'or', 'not', 'if', 'they', 'are', 'overcharging', 'me', 'or', 'if', 'what', 'they', 'say', 'i', 'owe', 'is', 'true', 'or', 'not', 'i', 'do', 'nt', 'like', 'to', 'be', 'late', 'in', 'my', 'payments', 'and', 'i', 'really', 'do', 'nt', 'feel', 'that', 'the', 'bank', 'is', 'being', 'honest', 'with', 'me', 'it', 'seems', 'they', 'apply', 'my', 'payments', 'in', 'the', 'amount', 'i', 'owe', 'from', 'the', 'statement', 'plus', 'from', 'the', 'current', 'purchases', 'but', 'it', 'is', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'they', 'are', 'applying', 'to', 'the', 'remaining', 'balance', 'from', 'my', 'transfers', 'i', 'can', 'show', 'you', 'my', 'last', 'statement', 'if', 'you', 'need', 'to', 'see', 'it', 'in', 'my', 'previous', 'statement', 'the', 'total', 'balance', 'was', 'xxxx', 'and', 'that', 's', 'what', 'i', 'paid', 'and', 'now', 'they', 'say', 'i', 'still', 'owe', 'twenty-six thousand', 'due', 'to', 'the', 'balance', 'transfer', 'in', 'the', 'page', 'where', 'they', 'post', 'the', 'interest', 'charge', 'calculation', 'the', 'balances', 'there', 'go', 'up', 'or', 'down', 'every', 'month', 'even', 'if', 'i', 'do', 'nt', 'do', 'any', 'new', 'balance', 'transfers', 'and', 'that', 'is', 'very', 'confusing']"
3,4,11,105,"A. Problem history synopsis : Medical ER visit in XX/XX/XXXX got behind in payments. Final payment in XXXX which lasted until XXXX XXXX, then account charged off and went to collections for 30 days, then collection attorney. Bank of America was told about medical hardship in XXXX before charge off several times as was the nonprofit and the attorney later. Bank of America was asked to provide forbearance arrangements but none were offered or responded to. B. Dunning Letter issued in XXXX around 40 days after charge off. Call was attempted to dispute amount. C. XXXX XXXX filed a lawsuit filing in my County civil ( lower court ). Bank of America, NA V. MY NAME D. I attempted to have account placed on Debt Management Plan DMP with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I had an account with before. XXXX XXXX took my money, told me in writing that I could show the DMP to the judge to waive and dismiss the suit, and then sent the money with a proposal to Bank. The Bank kept the money and said "" no '' to the proposal since it was "" in legal. '' E. I have a phone call documented and recorded with Bank of America in which customer service representative who may have told me it was an attempt to collect a debt nevertheless told me they did not "" own it '' anymore, implying that they sold it to XXXX XXXX and or XXXX XXXX XXXX. It turns out that the Bank still owns it and the collection attorney only represents them. F. Call # 1 to collection attorney phone call documented and recorded : XXXX XXXX XXXX representative coercing payment and arrangement plans against a default judgement that did not exist. Extended payment plan offered where the "" judgement '' would stay and not be removed. "" No other options '' existed etc. The color of law used against me to extract payment and collect a debt. My due process rights were usurped and obfuscated. The color of the law of a default judgement was used against me in order to collect a debt. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX obfuscated and clouded my rights as a consumer with a false statement about a judgement which did not exist I did not have any moment to present an attorney for them to speak to. This was especially apparent with second phone call. G. Second Call # 2 to collection attorney I asked again about an extended payment plan so I asked for a copy of that to review. They told me I had 30 days to get it back to them, however upon receiving the balance was incorrect and wrong. The paperwork had to be back in 10-14 days. The time passed due to the time that the proposal took to be mailed to me. So that passed due to fact I had a car accident. This customer service representative told me "" to shred and or tear up any lawsuit notification service papers that I might receive. '' This constitutes advice by XXXX XXXX XXXX such that they told me not to respond to a lawsuit they filed against me which would mean losing the lawsuit by default. Furthermore, because the first call ( point F above ) purported a default judgement against me, I was NOT able to seek advice of an attorney, thereby once again losing not only my consumer rights but my constitutional rights as an American citizen. H. Many faxes sent to XXXX XXXX attorney : ( 1 ) general dispute, ( 2 ) dispute of balance on "" agreed judgement '' as well as deceptive timelines for due dates given by Call # 2 & paperwork, ( 3 ) dispute # 3 asking for information regarding all credit cards ' lines which were consolidated into the present & original origination details including state of origination and copy of original application, ( 4 ) simple letter asking for a new agreed judgement with correct balance to review for consideration. No disputes were responded or handled correctly. I received one call from XXXX XXXX of Bank America in North Carolina. It was not clear what his phone call was about. I have disputed both the original debt accuracy via fax directly to Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX. They did not respond. I disputed the accuracy of both their original stated balance due as well as the balance listed on the agreed judgement papers since I have had made several payments since XX/XX/XXXX to Bank of America. I. Improper ( potentially illegal ) servicing techniques and Talking to a 3rd party about my debt : Visit # 1 -  XXXX dropped off a person to my wife 's brother in law. They told him they had papers from Bank. Brother-in-law asked to see them. Courier showed them to him the paperwork showing Bank of America, NA vs MY NAME Visit # 2 - lady drove to my parents house. Video exists of visitor showing paperwork to my mother who can confirm that the Bank 's name and my name were on the papers such that Bank of America, NA vs. MY NAME. These visits to 3rd parties were made to look like they were trying to find me, but they were really pressuring and embarrassing me in order to retrieve signature to the agreed judgement as described above G. Please note : My mother had night terrors for 3 days after this visit. She is XXXX years old. J. No agreed judgement was signed nor agreed to because the balance was incorrect. Also, the first XXXX XXXX XXXX employee who called me, XXXX XXXX, was documented on phone as saying there was a default judgement which would not be removed unless I paid in one payment, two payment or a four payment arrangement. This turned out to be false. The balance was never verified or corrected and I find this to be completely deceptive to me the consumer. K. Other Violations of Texas debt collection practices : 1. Texas Fair Debt Collection Practices Act part 392.202 violations occurred include parts ( A ) & ( B ) upon points 1, 2 & 3. 2. Requirement to provide address to send payment during phone calls attempting to collect on a debt in Texas : On no phone call by XXXX XXXX XXXX or phones calls going back to XXXX with Bank of America and or XXXX XXXX was an address provided for sending payment. This presented a highly ambiguous, deceptive, and confusing path of becoming compliant especially before and right after the charge-off period. L. Suit by XXXX XXXX XXXX did not provide any customary 2 week notice and was done without properly notifying me.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['a', 'problem', 'history', 'synopsis',

0,2,20,47,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made a check deposit of XXXX at the Bank of America ATM machine. This is something I have done for many years. After making the deposit I received access of only {$300.00} which as expected. After sending out several bills knowing my payroll would also hit my account on XX/XX/XXXX and expecting several automatic payments to go through I proceeded to spend my money on items needed in preparation for my son wedding. I believe on XX/XX/XXXX I was looking at my email and found a email from Bank of America that my account was -XXXX. I called customer service and was told the deposit I made on the XX/XX/XXXX was placed on a hold because of something that was written on the check, indicating the check could be insufficient. I asked the lady how was I supposed to know that this would happen, she stated you would not have known. and why did I have to find it in my email. When I asked if I could come get the check and go cash it at the bank it was written on she told me there was no way they could do this. I explained to her that I needed this money and there was several transactions coming in and all the BOA was doing was holding my check and charging me for {$35.00} for everything that comes in knowing they have a check with sufficient funds. The check was printed by Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The warrant number:XXXX, which guarantee the funds and I was informed by the Texas Comptroller these funds are guaranteed. This has cause much anguish, and has basically been a nightmare for me. I have no money, I cant use any of my credit cards because they have declined all payments, and I just do n't know what to do. This is wrong, I have had this account with BOA for over 17 years and have never received such a disservice.

0,16,20,47,"XXXX XXXX, 2017, This is an addendum to a complaint filed to The CFPB, file number XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, 2017, regarding multiple examples of gross violations of banking norms, malfeasance, inability to follow normal banking procedures, arrogance, shielding consumers from reaching a higher level of management to help solve problems beyond a receptionists skill set and/or training and clearly having a corporate culture and a mantra of "" that 's just they way it is ''. That is not an acceptable answer especially when BOA is holding a corporate check ( XXXX XXXX ) for nearly 30 days. NO BOA, NEWS FLASH -- -- -THAT IS NOT JUST THE WAY IT IS ( Or T.HE WAY IT SHOULD BE ). I was told that BOA held the check ( for 30 days?, in order to protect me? From whom? XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that issued the check? Since I have explained in detail my previous complaint, please allow me to list the chronological dates in order to show the absurdity in BOA 's business practices. Bank of America must feel that because it is a "" bank to big to faiil '', it is also a bank that is too big to perform properly. And this is what our tax dollars paid for? No wonder BOA does not care. XXXX XXXX, 2017, A check was issued to me ( XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX, the mortgage holder of my home and the lien older by XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$7900.00} Although beyond BOA 's banking accumen, XXXX XXXX XXXX was added as a co-signer in order to protect their investment in my home. Additionally, I had paid the contractor in full, {$8900.00}, upon the completion of the kitchen restoration as a result of flood damage. Knowing that I would soon have the money to cover the contractor ( less than one week ). The contractor, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), did and exceptional job in restoring my kitchen in record time, using additional employees to finish the job early. Similar to many small businesses, XXXX XXXX lives week to week in order to pay his employees on a weekly basis. I thought it unfair to use the BOA business model of withholding peoples money indefinitely. Unlike BOA, who can tie up one 's funds indefinitely in order to increase their profit by making inter-loan bank loans to other banks using OUR money. XXXX XXXX, 2017 XXXX XXXX XXXX issued a check to to both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was mailed to XXXX XXXX. I was given explicit instructions by both XXXX  XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX not to endorse the check, nor was I to make any marks on he check. I was to XXXX the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX for them to endorse the check and to place a "" hold harmless '' statement on the check. XXXX XXXX XXXX then XXXX XXXX the check to me for my deposit. XXXX XXXX, 2017, I deposited the dual endorsed check into my Bank of America Account and on my receipt, it said nothing more than a 10 day hold was in force. After the 10 day hold had passed, my funds were still not available to me. After hours on the phone, I was told that XXXX XXXX XXXX had not endorsed it, which I made a copy before depositing the check, and that statement was a blatant lie. The check had been endorsed by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon another hour of review, I was told that XXXX XXXX XXXX was not listed on my account, ( as a spouse would be, and therefore the check could not be deposited ). Another Blatant lie. How many people have their mortgage company listed on their check as a co-depositor/co-signor ''? Really ''. This is the Best that BOA can come up with? That was pure nonsense. Nonetheless, I was told the funds would be available on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or not later than after the weekend on XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, 2017 I asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in management. I do n't know what people in management do all day, but they certainly to not concern themselves with customer care/customer relations. No matter how many times I called, I could not break through the gatekeeper of the first line of defense. the customer service rep. Clearly, they were afraid to escalate calls for people who had legitimate problems to those executives in offices with windows and a view of the beautiful BOA campus. To a "" T '', and by rote, the answer I received from everyone was "" that 's just the way it is '' / And, curiously, nobody from BOA could produce the back side of the check that was endorsed by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am attaching two different correspondence to me where I requested a copy of the front and back of the check. Both times they could only produce a copy of the front of the check. Now, I am certainly not a banker, but I am a XXXX XXXX who keeps copies of every document, front and back. But this would elude BOA 's technical abilities? XXXX XXXX, 2017 I again called BOA and they invoked the "" legal '' clause, saying that legally, they had until XXXX XXXX to deliver the funds. Today is XXXX XXXX. No Funds.

0,2,20,47,"I filed a homeowner insurance claim with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) Insurance Company due to a flooded and thereby destroyed kitchen. XXXX issued to me a check on XXXX XXXX, 2017 for {$7900.00} payable to me and to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the holder of my mortgage and therefore, the singular lien holder on my home. XXXX endorsed the check and forwarded the check to me. I endorsed the check and deposited the check into my checking account at Bank of America ( BOA ) on XXXX XXXX, 2017. BOA placed a 10 day hold on the check, for unexplained reasons. On day 1XXXX XXXX of the 10 day hold, the funds were still not made available to me. I called BOA, and after being placed on and off of hold for two hours, I was told that the check was rejected because XXXX had not endorsed the check. When I requested that they again look at the back of the check, they discovered that the check had indeed been endorsed by XXXX. After being placed on hold for another 45 minutes, I was told that the check had been rejected because XXXX was not listed on my checking account, much like a spouse would be listed as an authorized person on my checking account. In addition to the absolute absurdity of the explanations offered by BOA in trying to cover-up their arbitrary and capricious reasoning for rejecting the insurance check, I explained to BOA that I was nevertheless responsible, beginning on XXXX XXXX, 2017, for making payments for my mortgage, my automobile loans as well as "" auto payment withdrawals '' for my car insurance, my life insurance policies for my grandchildren and certain other credit cards. Knowing that since my insurance check was rejected, that I would be unable to pay my mortgage and my automobile payment. I was also aware that once the "" auto payments '' were withdrawn for my automobile insurance, life insurance payments for my grandchildren and certain other credit card payments, that there would be insufficient funds to pay these creditors. I asked BOA how they would handle the punitive charges of {$35.00} assessed by BOA for each payment made using non sufficient funds ( NSF ). I also asked about the consequences of the fees charged by my creditors due to NSF 's. I was told, "" I hear you, but there is nothing we can do to help you ''. On my call to BOA on XXXX XXXX, I was told that my rejected check would arrive to my home possibly on XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, but no later than XXXX XXXX. With the arrival of no check, I called BOA daily, requesting the escalation of each call to a higher level of management withing BOA. Today, XXXX XXXX, BOA told me that the check was rejected in order to protect me, in case the payer, XXXX XXXX XXXX Insurance Company, did not have sufficient funds. Really? The largest insurer in the State of NJ not having sufficient funds to cover a payment to me for {$7900.00}? Meanwhile, in BOA 's efforts to protect me from financial predators, I am unable to pay my bills.
<P/>
Today, XXXX XXXX, I was told by BOA that by law they did not have to deliver the rejected check to me until XXXX XXXX. How refreshing that BOA is more concerned about their rights under the law than helping their customer to avoid delinquencies in payments to creditors. This, in addition, to causing permanent damage to my credit ratings and credit report.
<P/>
Shame on you Bank of America. You bully your customers in order to protect your profits. If you choose to continue with this arrogant attitude, there will be no need for you to concern yourself with profits. Without customers, there will not be any profits. And, sadly, as you alienate more and more customers, there will come a time where you can no longer cost shift by continuing to add more and more punitive policies. This is not rocket science. With virtual currencies becoming more mainstream, who will need the non-services of Bank of America.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'filed', 'a', 'homeowner', 'insurance', 'claim',

3,13,38,49,"Dear Sir, I am writing to confirm that I sent letters on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and several others regarding the verification of debt and thus lack of your company providing the required information. Additionally, I enclosed the Affidavit of Notice of Default that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX that is associated with your failure of verifying the alleged debt. I am providing notice that I am disputing the debt due to a variety of legal issues. <P/>As of yet, neither you nor your firm have fully complied with my detailed requests. There are ( 11 ) items noted below that your firm are required to provide in order to verify the allege debt. <P/>Upon extensive professional analysis of the alleged debt by a leading forensic specialist, I have obtained vital evidence ( Expert Witness Affidavit ) of extensive fraud, statutory and regulatory violations ( FDCPA, RESPA, TILA, SEC, IRS and UDAP ) associated with the allege debt that has caused me personal injury. The Expert Witness Affidavit is available for inspection upon request and will be used as an instrument to enforce legal rights. <P/>I am committed to litigate against all parties that have engaged in this fraudulent conduct and seek punitive damages unless a solution is provided. <P/><P/><P/>Under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, it mandates in FDCPA section 809 ( b ), 15 USC 1692g, if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection ( a ) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall CEASE AND DESIST collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, UNTIL the debt collector obtains VALIDATION OF THE DEBT. <P/>In XXXX vs. XXXX, the collector can not get a judgment until the debt is validated. <P/>This letter is being sent to you in response to a Notice of Acceleration and Foreclosure dated XX/XX/XXXX. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g sec. 809 ( b ) that your claim IS DISPUTED and VALIDATION is requested. <P/><P/><P/>This letter requests VALIDATION of the alleged debt accompanied by an Affidavit from the Alleged Lender. <P/>Please provide the following : 1. Copy of the original alleged note accompanied by an AFFIDAVIT from the alleged Lender 2. Identify to what the alleged debt pertains.
3. Provide details how the alleged debt was calculated. ( XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX Court,XX/XX/XXXX 4. Provide Regulation Z, and Notice of Right to Cancel ( Truth in Lending Act ) 5. Provide copies of any papers that show that I agreed to pay the alleged debt. 6. Identify the original creditor. 7. Provide the agreement between the creditor and your firm which authorizes you to collect funds ( without a contract, your firm has no right to foreclose ). 8. Provide evidence that the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account.
9. Provide evidence that you are licensed to collect in my state.
10. Provide the legal address of the alleged owner of the note 11. Please provide positive and affirmative proof of claim that the alleged loan promissory note and the deed of trust were transferred into to the REMIC at closing and acquired by real estate investment trust pursuant to Title 26 U.S.C. 856 ( e ) ( 1 ) to whom you alleged is the foreclosing entity.
<P/><P/><P/>
Upon receiving the requested information, I will require at least thirty ( 30 ) days to investigate this information. During such time, all collection activity must CEASE and DESIST. <P/>If your offices have reported unvalidated information to any of the three ( 3 ) major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX ), this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. If negative reporting is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent, I will bring legal action against you, pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. <P/>Also during this VALIDATION period, if ANY action is taken which could be considered detrimental, including negative reporting to credit bureaus which could be inaccurate or invalid, I will pursue legal action. <P/>If your offices fail to respond to this VALIDATION REQUEST within 30 days from the date of XX/XX/XXXX, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately. <P/>I also request that your office make no telephone calls to my home or place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have to pursue legal action. All future communications must be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by USPS or certified mail. <P/>This is an attempt to validate the alleged debt and to correct records, and information obtained will be used for that purpose. <P/>If foreclosure proceedings, collection activities and sale date advertisements and are not stopped before XX/XX/XXXX, I will send letters directly to Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Attorney General Consumer Protection Office, Department of Housing and Urban Development ( file under RESPA regulations ), FDIC, Department of Banking and Finance and the Georgia Bar Association ( for disregarding and failing to comply with Federal Code ). <P/>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Section 15 809, gives everyone who may have a loan certain consumer rights, whether or not the loan servicing has transferred. The FDCPA is intended for any DEBT COLLECTOR including MORTGAGES. If a borrower sends a VALIDATION OF DEBT letter to the present loan servicer, other alleged lender, or entity or company attempting to collect, all requested documentation must be provided to the borrower within 30 days of receipt of the request. During this 30 day period, the Lender or Servicer or Collector must suspend any and all collection activity ( including FORECLOSURE OF THE PROPERTY ) until the debt has been legally validated and VALIDATION has been received. <P/>If any debt collector fails to comply with the validation of debt notice the borrower is entitled to an award of actual damages, statutory damages up to {$1000.00} ( per count ), cost and attorneys fees. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1692k ( a ). Class action relief is also available. 15 U.S.C. Sec 1692k ( a ) ( B ). <P/>Any debt collector who violates any provision of the FDCPA has a potential liability for the actual damages. A single violation is more than sufficient to support judgment for the borrower/consumer. See :  XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ; XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX). There can be actual damages which includes emotional stress, embarrassment, and humiliation caused by improper activities and conduct during their debt collection activities. The FDCPA allows recovery of Statutory damages limited to 1 % of the debt collector 's net worth or {$500000.00}, whichever is less. <P/>

0,2,28,106,"I would like to reopen a disputed transaction that Bank of America considered as resolved. It is about my recent dispute transaction with XXXX ( Claim ID:XXXX ). XXXX took out {$100.00} from my account without my authorization because their ticket buyer claimed that I sold invalid tickets. XXXX emailed me about this and asked me to obtain every proof that I can get from the venue itself, as well as my proof of purchase. I replied to their email right away and gave them everything they asked for ; however, the venue was not able to give me ticket scans. I sent XXXX all my chat conversations, and they have decided to take out the money from my account without giving me proof that their buyer was telling the truth. I am furious that Bank of America allowed XXXX to take out money from my account without my authorization. During the dispute process, XXXX sent them data and information about the transaction, and sent them user agreements from their website. As quote on quote stated on their user agreement : "" If you fail to respond to this email and or to take any other actions required by XXXX to investigate the invalid ticket claim, you may be charged an amount equal to 55 % of the cost of the original tickets. In addition to the invalid ticket charge described in the paragraph above. A respnse constitutes an acknowledgment of our request and bonafide the effort to investigate the clain and obtain documentation.

1,8,30,22,"I recently traveled to XXXX XXXX, and brought a Bank of America credit card with me. No issues using it until the last day. Stopped to get gas for the rental car prior to returning it, and was given a slip to sign ( 1 ) and then given back a receipt ( 2 ) for the correct amount. After getting home, a charge for much more than the receipt ( 2 ) amount posted to my credit card. I disputed the charge as an "" incorrect transaction amount '' with Bank of America, assuming it was a simple mistake and they could work it out with the gas station. The station sent back a receipt ( 3 ) that I did not sign - it was forged, and Bank of America said there was nothing they could do, because the card was present at the transaction, and I did not have the "" correct '' receipt. I did n't realize the final receipt given to me ( 2 ) was from a different customer 's credit card, even though the dollar amount matches the dollar amount that I had originally signed for on receipt ( 1 ). I was never given a copy of my signed receipt when I left, just like in a restaurant.
<P/>
After all that, I disputed again, this time as a "" fraud '' dispute - citing my forged signature and providing evidence of my signature. I just received word that this claim has also been denied.
<P/>
Thank you for your help in this matter. Please see below for a timeline and the attached supporting documentation. <P/>Important Dates : XX/XX/XXXX - Bank of America credit card used at gas station in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Receipt given to me at time of sale showed purchase amount of XXXX XXXX ( about $ 26-27 XXXX dollars ). XX/XX/XXXX - Transaction for {$140.00} shows as pending, and then posts on either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX.
XX/XX/XXXX - Original dispute filed, for transaction amount charged. I disputed {$110.00} ( meaning I was comfortable paying at most {$30.00} for the gas purchase ). {$110.00} was immediately credited to my account.
XX/XX/XXXX - Notified that the claim was denied. BoA sent a letter via mail and my online banking. Online banking also included a copy of the merchant provided receipt for XXXX XXXX ( lines up with {$140.00} charge, this is referred to receipt ( 3 ) above ). I never signed receipt 3, it is not my signature. I called BoA the next day, and they asked me to send in some information I had, including the receipt I was given ( 2 ). XX/XX/XXXX - Went to a BoA branch and faxed in the attached "" XXXX Full Package. '' This includes receipts ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) as well as a letter detailing the issue. XX/XX/XXXX - Received a letter from BoA ( mail and online banking ) explaining that the claim still could not be honored. See attached "" XXXX Claim Letter. '' I called again and explained that the signature was forged, BoA again said they needed more information. XX/XX/XXXX - Stopped by BoA branch and faxed the attached "" XXXX Full Package. '' Included is my current license ( to prove signature ), as well as the receipts ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), and BoA 's letters. I again called BoA and explained the situation. They said there was nothing they could do, because the card was present at the the transaction and there was a signature. XX/XX/XXXX - At the suggestion of a BoA employee I spoke with on the phone, I filed a fraud dispute for the charge online. This transaction is not something I authorized, so I think it should be labelled as fraud. Somebody took my card, swiped it for a purchase I did n't authorize, and the forged my signature.

1,8,1,48,"Late last year I opened a credit account with Bank of America, due to the terms and rewards advertising I decided to apply and was approved. Then about 4 or 5 months later they closed the account without explanation and told me they would not reopen it. I then asked if that would affect my rate to which they responded that it would not so I kept making my minimum payments since I figured at zero percent I was better to do it that way. Suddenly my minimum payment goes up about 3 or 4 months ago. I told them what the problem was and they told me I qualified for no such thing ( zero interest ) and in fact I had been always paying interest, and now my promotion was over and my interest was to be 28.99 % to which so far they have changed several times, I think the last one they gave me was 20 or 21 %. First they gave me a rate that was low or so I though and then they close the account without me being able to accumulate more rewards or take advantage of the rate for the full terms.

0,2,4,28,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check from one of our clients into our BoA business checking account. The following day I noticed that the check was placed on an extended hold and so then processed to reach out to the bank to see what was the cause oh the hold. The bank claimed that they could not verify the check, rather, that could not confirm that the check was written out to us even though the client clearly made the payment out to us. After speaking to multiple bank representatives and being placed on ridiculously long hold I then came to learn that BoA was closing our business account with them and would not render any explanation as to why they were doing so. BoA then decided to hold the check that I deposited along with the funds in our account, they disabled our ability to view the online banking portal thus making it impossible to transfer funds onto new account in order to continue conducting business. I made several attempts to regain access to our account, BoA representatives were not interested in helping us resolve this issue, they would constantly transfer me to a new person would then give me the same information that the previous person gave, and would they continue to not provide us with any explanation as to WHY this was happening. I also asked to speak to a department manager and was always denied. It has now been over three weeks and the issue is yet to be  resolved, BoA claims that the account is still in the process of closure, and I have not received the check that I attempted to deposit. As a result this has caused a serious strain on our business andcaused us to miss payments due to vendors and such, and has disabled our ability to conduct  business.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'deposited', 'a', 'check', 'from', 'one', 'of', 'our', 'clients', 'into', 'our', 'boa', 'business', 'checking', 'account', 'the', 'following', 'day', 'i', 'noticed', 'that', 'the', 'check', 'was', 'placed', 'on', 'an', 'extended', 'hold', 'and', 'so', 'then', 'processed', 'to', 'reach', 'out', 'to', 'the', 'bank', 'to', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'the', 'cause', 'oh', 'the', 'hold', 'the', 'bank', 'claimed', 'that', 'they', 'could', 'not', 'verify', 'the', 'check', 'rather', 'that', 'could', 'not', 'confirm', 'that', 'the', 'check', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'to', 'us', 'even', 'though', 'the', 'client', 'clearly', 'made', 'the', 'payment', 'out', 'to', 'us', 'after', 'speaking', 'to', 'multiple', 'bank', 'representatives', 'and', 'being', 'placed', 'on', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'hold', 'i', 'then', 'came', 'to', 'learn', 'that', 'boa', 'was', 'closing', 'our', 'business', 'account', 'with', 'them', 'and', 'would', 'not', 'render', 'any', 'explanation', 'as', 'to', 'why', 'they', 'were', 'doing', 'so', 'boa', 'then', 'decided', 'to', 'hold', 'the', 'check', 'that', 'i', 'deposited', 'along', 'with', 'the', 'funds', 'in', 'our', 'account', 'they', 'disabled', 'our', 'ability', 'to', 'view', 'the', 'online', 'banking', 'portal', 'thus', 'making', 'it', 'impossible', 'to', 'transfer', 'funds', 'onto', 'new', 'account', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'continue', 'conducting', 'business', 'i', 'made', 'several', 'attempts', 'to', 'regain', 'access', 'to', 'our', 'account', 'boa', 'representatives', 'were', 'not', 'interested', 'in', 'helping', 'us', 'resolve', 'this', 'issue', 'they', 'would', 'constantly', 'transfer', 'me', 'to', 'a', 'new', 'person', 'would', 'then', 'give', 'me', 'the', 'same', 'information', 'that', 'the', 'previous', 'person', 'gave', 'and', 'would', 'they', 'continue', 'to', 'not', 'provide', 'us', 'with', 'any', 'explanation', 'as', 'to', 'why', 'this', 'was', 'happening', 'i', 'also', 'asked', 'to', 'speak', 'to', 'a', 'department', 'manager', 'and', 'was', 'always', 'denied', 'it', 'has', 'now', 'been', 'over', 'three', 'weeks', 'and', 'the', 'issue', 'is', 'yet', 'to', 'be', 'resolved', 'boa', 'claims', 'that', 'the', 'account', 'is', 'still', 'in', 'the', 'process', 'of', 'closure', 'and', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'received', 'the', 'check', 'that', 'i', 'attempted', 'to', 'deposit', 'as', 'a', 'result', 'this', 'has', 'caused', 'a', 'serious', 'strain', 'on', 'our', 'business', 'andcaused', 'us', 'to', 'miss', 'payments', 'due', 'to', 'vendors', 'and', 'such', 'and', 'has', 'disabled', 'our', 'ability', 'to', 'conduct', 'business']"
2,5,19,0,"I have been monitoring my credit score for the last 2-3 years.
I signed up for XXXX in XXXX of 2015 and have been monitoring my credit report and score. XXXX has FICO scores, and they currently give me a score of XXXX.
I also signed up for XXXX earlier this year because they seem to use a different model called XXXXXXXX XXXX. My score on XXXX is XXXX.
Bank of America seems to use FICO scores from XXXX. However, neither their FICO score, nor XXXX score matches my credit score on either of the individual credit bureaus. BofA gives me a XXXX. Not sure how they come to this score and they wo n't give an explanation.
When I visited a BofA branch, I asked the representative about this and they did not have an answer for me. They just said we pull the score from XXXX, to which I told them that my score on XXXX is much different that what they show me. BofA credit score makes it difficult for me to ask for a credit line increase, they have turned me down once already.
My job requires me to travel quite a bit and use my credit card for flight and hotel bookings, and I have to keep paying it off 3 to 4 times a month every time I travel.
It would be great if BofA could explain how they give me the credit score they show on online banking and correct it to what XXXX actually shows as my credit score.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'have', 'been', 'monitoring', 'my', 'credit', 'score', 'for', 'the', 'last', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'i', 'signed', 'up', 'for', 'xxxx', 'in', 'xxxx', 'of', 'two thousand and fifteen', 'and', 'have', 'been', 'monitoring', 'my', 'credit', 'report', 'and', 'score', 'xxxx', 'has', 'fico', 'scores', 'and', 'they', 'currently', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'score', 'of', 'xxxx', 'i', 'also', 'signed', 'up', 'for', 'xxxx', 'earlier', 'this', 'year', 'because', 'they', 'seem', 'to', 'use', 'a', 'different', 'model', 'called', 'xxxxxxxx', 'xxxx', 'my', 'score', 'on', 'xxxx', 'is', 'xxxx', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'seems', 'to', 'use', 'fico', 'scores', 'from', 'xxxx', 'however', 'neither', 'their', 'fico', 'score', 'nor', 'xxxx', 'score', 'matches', 'my', 'credit', 'score', 'on', 'either', 'of', 'the', 'individual', 'credit', 'bureaus', 'bofa', 'gives', 'me', 'a', 'xxxx', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'they', 'come', 'to', 'this', 'score', 'and', 'they', 'wo', 'nt', 'give', 'an', 'explanation', 'when', 'i', 'visited', 'a', 'bofa', 'branch', 'i', 'asked', 'the', 'representative', 'about', 'this', 'and', 'they', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'an', 'answer', 'for', 'me', 'they', 'just', 'said', 'we', 'pull', 'the', 'score', 'from', 'xxxx', 'to', 'which', 'i', 'told', 'them', 'that', 'my', 'score', 'on', 'xxxx', 'is', 'much', 'different', 'that', 'what', 'they', 'show', 'me', 'bofa', 'credit', 'score', 'makes', 'it', 'difficult', 'for', 'me', 'to', 'ask', 'for', 'a', 'credit', 'line', 'increase', 'they', 'have', 'turned', 'me', 'down', 'once', 'already', 'my', 'job', 'requires', 'me', 'to', 'travel', 'quite', 'a', 'bit', 'and', 'use', 'my', 'credit', 'card', 'for', 'flight', 'and', 'hotel', 'bookings', 'and', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'keep', 'paying', 'it', 'off', 'three', 'to', 'four', 'times', 'a', 'month', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'travel', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'if', 'bofa', 'could', 'explain', 'how', 'they', 'give', 'me', 'the', 'credit', 'score', 'they', 'show', 'on', 'online', 'banking', 'and', 'correct', 'it', 'to', 'what', 'xxxx', 'actually', 'shows', 'as', 'my', 'credit', 'score']"
0,2,20,57,"My husband and I ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) have a joint account at Bank of America. The recent balance in the account was approx {$24000.00}.

Neither my husband nor I know who the joint account holder is. {$140000.00} was successfully transferred to the fraudulent account. Essentially it was explained to us that my husband was a victim of identity theft. On XX/XX/XXXX I was initially assured that the money would be restored to our account and once restored I could go to the branch and close out my account that had been breached and created a new account to transfer the funds in to. Unfortunetly the funds we never transferred back to my account. I am now told that this will not happen until the fraud investigation is complete and that this could take up to 30 days! I find this unacceptable. I do n't understand why my funds have to be tied up for 30 days. We have presented proper ID at the bank and still we are told 30 days. I have been a customer of Bank of America for at least 15 years. This is not a small amount of money and I find this to be inappropriate and unethical.

'' I am told I 'm responsible to contact ( XXXX ) to return the money. <P/>Now I contact XXXX- The XXXX account supervisor/escalator XXXX on XXXX XXXX tells me it is impossible to return funds directly to BofA -1 ) as funds have not yet cleared. 2 ) When funds do clear, the only possible way for money to be returned, is for me to continue to wait for a physical check to be written ( by XXXX ) to me and to then be put by XXXX into the USPS mail ( with an stamp ) and then for me to wait to receive it at my mailbox-sometime in the future-and then to get in a car and physically take it to my local bank to make a deposit in person, that must physically clear again, and then only after- it can be sent back to BofA for a payment. <P/>*Why can not money sent electronically in the 1st place- be sent back? <P/><P/>I call back to try once again in the evening on the XXXX to remedy the situation and to inform them I am really wanting to find a solution here & have contacted federal agencies but would prefer to try solution with a supervisor. XXXX asks me for XXXX account # & legitimately seems to be attempting to seek some solution. She tells me to never do balance transfers online, but to call in person- as they are known for being a faulty process and she has heard of instances where ppls money was sent to the wrong places. Again she says I have to get money the from XXXX -this is the only option. I say ok, but Im going ahead with my BBB and DFR complaints as this is simply not satisfactory. At which point she offers a Manager. I say great! <P/>Then floor manager-XXXX actually tells me point blank I made this almost 5K error myself, typed in that number & it is ABSOLUTELY my fault all this happened & that they have zero 'system errors ' on their part ( actual quote ). Of course there is no copy of my original online application -which I have requested-being provided to me. Just unfounded accusations. At this point, I actually tell XXXX he is absolutely wrong. Seeing no solution offered- I promptly hang up. This is actually the poorest treatment I have ever received. Especially by management. My last cards were pretty awful ( previously I required the BBB and CFPB to achieve solutions for payments cashed, but never credited. <P/>Perhaps this is an actual predatory strategy, to send me a large personal check. Maybe they assume I wont pay it off, but will spend it instead. If so-horrendous practice. <P/><P/>Instead of waiting to see how much more poorly this matter will continue to be handled between these two companies, I am asking this Agency to contact BofA ( and also XXXX ) to immediately clear this issue!

Over the past three years the victims have taken more than $ 100K from her Bank of America accounts ( checkings/savings/IRA/CD 's ). I have been going back and fourth with Bank of America since XXXX of this year and Bank of America is refusing to reimburse XXXX sufficiently and failing to provide me with documentation stating the proper protocol for this matter as far as being reimbursement. I was informed by several managers of Bank of America located on the The XXXX in XXXX XXXX that she would be reimbursed for her funds IF we were willing to press charges against the victims, which we are currently in the process of doing. Once informed, I immediately contacted the XXXX county Sheriff dept and the victims are currently being investigated. I provided Bank of America Check Fraud Dept AND the Electronic fraud dept with the police report number and the name and contact number of the detective that 's currently investigating on her behalf. I received correspondence from the check fraud dept ( X/XX/17 ) stating that Bank of America would only be willing to reimburse XXXX {$1500.00} for the check fraud claim ( claim # XXXX ) and rec'vd a letter dated ( X/XX/17 ) stating that the they would be reimbursing {$1300.00} for the electronic fraud claim ( claim # XXXX ). Due to amount of fraudulent transactions/withdrawals on this account, I had to compile a spreadsheet. To date, I have contacted Bank of America on the following dates : X/X/17 spoke with covering manager XXXX who stated that Bank of America would reimburse XXXX as long as we 're willing to press charges, X/XX/17 spoke with XXXX XXXX ( manager ) who stated that Bank of America will reimburse as long as we 're willing to press charges, X/XX/17 called fraud dept, spoke to XXXX who stated that claim had not yet been assigned, X/XX/17 mailed letter with attached spreadsheet to Bank of America Corporate office @ XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX ( which was given to me by XXXX in the fraud dept ) ; X/X/17 spoke with XXXX XXXX, X/X/17- called Fraud dept and spoke with XXXX to file an electronic investigation claim because I was not informed on X/X/17 that I would have to file two separate claims. X/XX/17 Called claims dept and spoke to XXXX who stated that Bank of America is only willing to reimburse {$1500.00} for the check fraud investigation because they were not notified within 60 days but could not provide me anything in writing re : company policy where that was stated. X/XX/17- spoke with XXXX re : electronic claim who stated they 're in need of an affidavit, X/XX/17- spoke with XXXX from escalated dept at XXXX who advised me to send a letter with spreadsheet to the corporate office XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX, letter was sent and no one ever responded to my letter.

1,8,1,48,"I applied for the XXXX XXXX XXXX card and feel as though I received an unfair and misleading bait-and-switch offer. Apparently there are two credit card options -- which have very different terms and benefits -- the XXXX Signature has all of the benefits that are emphasized in the advertising, and the Platinum Plus XXXX, which has many many fewer benefits, including 1/6 of the bonus miles, no free checked baggage, and a significantly reduced companion ticket benefit. While it mentions this possibility on the application website, it was not clear to me during the application process that I had actually received the lower-tiered version. ( Unfortunately, I do n't have a screenshot of this process, however, I do not recall there being any verbiage indicating that I had not been approved for the XXXX Signature -- it must have just said I was approved for the Platinum Plus, which at the time I did n't realize was  different. ) It was also not clear that there were such different benefits between the two options. Furthermore, I was not given the option to state whether I was in fact interested in this lower-option ( which I was n't ) : once I applied and was approved for the lower version, I did not have the option to decline. So, essentially, I applied thinking I was going to get one card, was apparently not approved for it, and was automatically given a different card which I would never have applied for in the first place. It is also unclear to me why I was n't approved for the better option. I have a pretty good credit score ( XXXX ), and have other lines of credit that are in good standing. I tried calling Bank of America, and they were not able to provide me with answers. They only told me that I could reapply, but that I would n't get the additional bonus miles. I declined, and closed my account. I 'm sure Bank of America has covered its behind by putting all of this in the legalese of fine print, but honestly I consider myself a fairly savvy customer and I was still duped. I do n't think that, even if it says so in the fine print, you should be able to apply for one credit card and end up with another, with very different terms and benefits.

I was not provided the contact information for the legal department and was told I would have to find that information for myself. I then filed an OCC complaint and was called by a Bank of America representative who handles OCC complaints. She verified she had received the complaint and would get back to me that day after some research. Not hearing from her I had to initiate contact myself once again. I talked to a woman in the account closure department and XXXX XXXX XXXX whom I believe is in some type of resolution role. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX ext XXXX who originally called me about the OCC complaint. After much discussion, I was told a check for MY FUNDS could not be stopped and that I would have to wait 90 days to see if the check had been cashed.

1,8,23,84,"I held a spousal ( second ) card a Bank of America credit card last year with an account ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my wife and together visited a Bank of America financial center branch in XXXX, MN. Our goal was to change my status from mere second cardholder to a fully-authorized co-holder so I could use Bank of Americas web portal to download rewards airline points earned ; I had been denied access when attempting that task a month prior. XXXX XXXX XXXX served us behind a counter as relationship banker that day, her business card below. Upon learning the details of our request she said that such a credit card status change was not possible and insisted we close XXXX and open a new one. I found it odd at the time, it seemed a simple technical matter to me. I inquired if the large amount of points we had accrued that year would seamlessly transition to a new account. She checked with her supervisor who was on site that morning and he said, yes indeed. So my wife and I went down that path that day, which was rather lengthy ; later we were sent new account cards ending in XXXX with co-equal status as requested. What did not ever happen was the transfer of airline rewards points from one account to the other. I made phone inquiries about his matter on XX/XX/XXXX ( with XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX, ( XXXX ), and today, XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), to resolve the matter of my XXXX lost points. Case numbers were assigned by the seven Bank of American customer services agents named above ( XXXX, XXXX ) with promises for resolution based on further research. Whenever I phoned I asked if the agent could review case notes but adequate notes were never entered they said ; ultimately the answer was always "" no. '' I view the whole matter now, a year in hindsight, to be a scam of the sort appearing in the press last year pertaining to similar serial transgressions by XXXX XXXX.

We reported it to Bank of America, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX. Phone number is XXXX XXXX. Their internal fraud report apparently says that some one in the XXXX region open a debit card in my name. Our address is XXXX XXXX, Florida, XXXX. My wife has a debit card but I do not. Apparently the fraudulent card was opened in XXXX ( XXXX ), Florida which is on the west side of Florida and we live n the XXXX side. The person apparently attempted to withdraw money through an ATM machine connected to Delaware from a Bank of American office but was declined. He went to a Bank of America teller and withdrew {$7000.00} and than went to another location and withdrew {$8000.00}. I have been assured that if the money was fraudulently taken I will get it back. My issue is it is a lot of money for my wife and I and we have asked Bank of America twice to at least confirm in writing that the fraud happened and they are investigating and need a certain period of time to complete their investigation. We call the fraud line but get a different state and obviously a different person each time we call and they give no information except that it will take 30 to 60 days. I am concerned that at the end of this period they may not even acknowledge they are working on it. Even though Bank of America has promised to send an acknowledgement letter to us by email and by mail we have not received anything. This may be standard procedure and they may have to be very careful on what they say. This is my first experience in dealing with something like this. I am also surprised they do not make it clearer that we our covered by various financial regulations to help us alleviate our financial fear. The Bank of America local office has been very nice but all they can do is call they same fraud line that we call and get the same answer. I guess I am really concerned that if I am patient that in 60 days they will still not tell us anything.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'one million, five hundred thousand', 'was', 'fraudulently', 'withdrawn', 'from', 'our', 'savings', 'account', 'with', 'a', 'use', 'of', 'a', 'debit', 'account', 'our', 'bank', 'is', 'bank', 'of', 'american', 'who', 'we', 'contacted', 'immediately', 'we', 'reported', 'it', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'florida', 'xxxx', 'phone', 'number', 'is', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'their', 'internal', 'fraud', 'report', 'apparently', 'says', 'that', 'some', 'one', 'in', 'the', 'xxxx', 'region', 'open', 'a', 'debit', 'card', 'in', 'my', 'name', 'our', 'address', 'is', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'florida', 'xxxx', 'my', 'wife', 'has', 'a', 'debit', 'card', 'but', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'apparently', 'the', 'fraudulent', 'card', 'was', 'opened', 'in', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'florida', 'which', 'is', 'on', 'the', 'west', 'side', 'of', 'florida', 'and', 'we', 'live', 'n', 'the', 'xxxx', 'side', 'the', 'person', 'apparently', 'attempted', 'to', 'withdraw', 'money', 'through', 'an', 'atm', 'machine', 'connected', 'to', 'delaware', 'from', 'a', 'bank', 'of', 'american', 'office', 'but', 'was', 'declined', 'he', 'went', 'to', 'a', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'teller', 'and', 'withdrew', 'seven hundred thousand', 'and', 'than', 'went', 'to', 'another', 'location', 'and', 'withdrew', 'eight hundred thousand', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'assured', 'that', 'if', 'the', 'money', 'was', 'fraudulently', 'taken', 'i', 'will', 'get', 'it', 'back', 'my', 'issue', 'is', 'it', 'is', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'money', 'for', 'my', 'wife', 'and', 'i', 'and', 'we', 'have', 'asked', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'twice', 'to', 'at', 'least', 'confirm', 'in', 'writing', 'that', 'the', 'fraud', 'happened', 'and', 'they', 'are', 'investigating', 'and', 'need', 'a', 'certain', 'period', 'of', 'time', 'to', 'complete', 'their', 'investigation', 'we', 'call', 'the', 'fraud', 'line', 'but', 'get', 'a', 'different', 'state', 'and', 'obviously', 'a', 'different', 'person', 'each', 'time', 'we', 'call', 'and', 'they', 'give', 'no', 'information', 'except', 'that', 'it', 'will', 'take', 'thirty', 'to', 'sixty', 'days', 'i', 'am', 'concerned', 'that', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'this', 'period', 'they', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'they', 'are', 'working', 'on', 'it', 'even', 'though', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'promised', 'to', 'send', 'an', 'acknowledgement', 'letter', 'to', 'us', 'by', 'email', 'and', 'by', 'mail', 'we', 'have', 'not', 'received', 'anything', 'this', 'may', 'be', 'standard', 'procedure', 'and', 'they', 'may', 'have', 'to', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'on', 'what', 'they', 'say', 'this', 'is', 'my', 'first', 'experience', 'in', 'dealing', 'with', 'something', 'like', 'this', 'i', 'am', 'also', 'surprised', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'it', 'clearer', 'that', 'we', 'our', 'covered', 'by', 'various', 'financial', 'regulations', 'to', 'help', 'us', 'alleviate', 'our', 'financial', 'fear', 'the', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'local', 'office', 'has', 'been', 'very', 'nice', 'but', 'all', 'they', 'can', 'do', 'is', 'call', 'they', 'same', 'fraud', 'line', 'that', 'we', 'call', 'and', 'get', 'the', 'same', 'answer', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'am', 'really', 'concerned', 'that', 'if', 'i', 'am', 'patient', 'that', 'in', 'sixty', 'days', 'they', 'will', 'still', 'not', 'tell', 'us', 'anything']"

I called BOA on XX/XX/XXXX ; the day I received the letter and spoke to XXXX. XXXX instructed me to ignore the letter as the claim was resolved in my favor. I questioned him several times regarding this as it made no sense that they would send a letter on a closed claim. He assured me the claim was in fact closed and I needed to do nothing further. At XXXX AM the following day XXXX, I received an email from BOA stating my claim was forfeited as I did not respond by the deadline. I called BOA and spoke to XXXX. He informed me that XXXX was mistaken and indeed I had missed the deadline to respond. He also informed me that the merchant had 45 days to respond, BOA had 30 days and because they were doing research that only gave me a week to respond. He did allow me to respond today and still make the deadline. Apparently the merchants and Banks have more rights than the consumer that was defrauded. Not only can a merchant send in any response regardless of merit but the bank can sit on it and do nothing to wind out the clock. They can then give you no time to respond and blame you for missing a deadline that has passed.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'am', 'disputing', 'a', 'transaction', 'on', 'my', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'card', 'i', 'initiated', 'the', 'dispute', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'have', 'received', 'no', 'correspondence', 'until', 'yesterday', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'letter', 'i', 'received', 'stated', 'i', 'needed', 'to', 'reply', 'by', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'day', 'before', 'the', 'letter', 'also', 'included', 'a', 'rebuttal', 'from', 'the', 'merchant', 'which', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'with', 'the', 'claim', 'i', 'called', 'boa', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'day', 'i', 'received', 'the', 'letter', 'and', 'spoke', 'to', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'instructed', 'me', 'to', 'ignore', 'the', 'letter', 'as', 'the', 'claim', 'was', 'resolved', 'in', 'my', 'favor', 'i', 'questioned', 'him', 'several', 'times', 'regarding', 'this', 'as', 'it', 'made', 'no', 'sense', 'that', 'they', 'would', 'send', 'a', 'letter', 'on', 'a', 'closed', 'claim', 'he', 'assured', 'me', 'the', 'claim', 'was', 'in', 'fact', 'closed', 'and', 'i', 'needed', 'to', 'do', 'nothing', 'further', 'at', 'xxxx', 'am', 'the', 'following', 'day', 'xxxx', 'i', 'received', 'an', 'email', 'from', 'boa', 'stating', 'my', 'claim', 'was', 'forfeited', 'as', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'respond', 'by', 'the', 'deadline', 'i', 'called', 'boa', 'and', 'spoke', 'to', 'xxxx', 'he', 'informed', 'me', 'that', 'xxxx', 'was', 'mistaken', 'and', 'indeed', 'i', 'had', 'missed', 'the', 'deadline', 'to', 'respond', 'he', 'also', 'informed', 'me', 'that', 'the', 'merchant', 'had', 'forty-five', 'days', 'to', 'respond', 'boa', 'had', 'thirty', 'days', 'and', 'because', 'they', 'were', 'doing', 'research', 'that', 'only', 'gave', 'me', 'a', 'week', 'to', 'respond', 'he', 'did', 'allow', 'me', 'to', 'respond', 'today', 'and', 'still', 'make', 'the', 'deadline', 'apparently', 'the', 'merchants', 'and', 'banks', 'have', 'more', 'rights', 'than', 'the', 'consumer', 'that', 'was', 'defrauded', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'a', 'merchant', 'send', 'in', 'any', 'response', 'regardless', 'of', 'merit', 'but', 'the', 'bank', 'can', 'sit', 'on', 'it', 'and', 'do', 'nothing', 'to', 'wind', 'out', 'the', 'clock', 'they', 'can', 'then', 'give', 'you', 'no', 'time', 'to', 'respond', 'and', 'blame', 'you', 'for', 'missing', 'a', 'deadline', 'that', 'has', 'passed']"

0,2,28,106,"I am writing about an issue that I faced with bank of America account. Thsi happened on XXXX XXXX, 2017. I was being scamed for XXXX dollars. I met someone on facebook who was interested in renting my apartment. So for an initial advance for {$200.00} dollars i gave them my account number. Next, i heard that she transferred me XXXX instead of XXXX and wanted her money back. I transferred her the money back as i thought that is the most ethical thing to do ( I agree that this was my fault ). Next she told me that the money I transferred bounced back and when i checked my BoFa account and yes the money was returned to me as a credit adjustement. Therefore she asked me to transfer again and i did. Next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my account and there are no sign of themoney that she initially transferred. She obviously pulled it back and i knew i lost XXXX dollars. My problem started when I asked the BoFa customer personnel about the credit adjustment that I was seeing in my account which in the first place made me transfer an extra XXXX dollars to that first. Bofa customer person told me that it is from a claim that i initiated for a ATM deposit. I told them I never initiatedany such claim. So we tried to tarck who initially filed that claim. We came to know that someone impersonated me and called BoFa and filed that claim. This is a clear case of identity theft and fraud. But bank of america is not considering this as a fruad and not takinh any action to get me atleast the {$2000.00} that i only paid because i saw that credit in my account. After some more digging, I came to know that some one ( a male ) called bank of america ( though I am a female and solely hold the account ). The person was able to identify himself as me by giving my account number ( i gave for initial transfer ) and date of birth ( from my XXXX profile ). He failed multiple time to identify himself on the type of account, last deposit as well as the CVV number ( because he never had that info ). BoFa should have stopped him there and atleast had called on the cell number associated with the account to confirm the activity. They never called me but the customer agen XXXX XXXX escalated the case to her manager XXXX XXXX and she gave him what he wanted. I feel Bofa was very negligent while dealing this case and now they are not even accepting the fact that it was there mistake.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'am', 'writing', 'about', 'an', 'issue', 'that', 'i', 'faced', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'account', 'thsi', 'happened', 'on', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'two thousand and seventeen', 'i', 'was', 'being', 'scamed', 'for', 'xxxx', 'dollars', 'i', 'met', 'someone', 'on', 'facebook', 'who', 'was', 'interested', 'in', 'renting', 'my', 'apartment', 'so', 'for', 'an', 'initial', 'advance', 'for', 'twenty thousand', 'dollars', 'i', 'gave', 'them', 'my', 'account', 'number', 'next', 'i', 'heard', 'that', 'she', 'transferred', 'me', 'xxxx', 'instead', 'of', 'xxxx', 'and', 'wanted', 'her', 'money', 'back', 'i', 'transferred', 'her', 'the', 'money', 'back', 'as', 'i', 'thought', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'most', 'ethical', 'thing', 'to', 'do', 'i', 'agree', 'that', 'this', 'was', 'my', 'fault', 'next', 'she', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'the', 'money', 'i', 'transferred', 'bounced', 'back', 'and', 'when', 'i', 'checked', 'my', 'bofa', 'account', 'and', 'yes', 'the', 'money', 'was', 'returned', 'to', 'me', 'as', 'a', 'credit', 'adjustement', 'therefore', 'she', 'asked', 'me', 'to', 'transfer', 'again', 'and', 'i', 'did', 'next', 'day', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'checked', 'my', 'account', 'and', 'there', 'are', 'no', 'sign', 'of', 'themoney', 'that', 'she', 'initially', 'transferred', 'she', 'obviously', 'pulled', 'it', 'back', 'and', 'i', 'knew', 'i', 'lost', 'xxxx', 'dollars', 'my', 'problem', 'started', 'when', 'i', 'asked', 'the', 'bofa', 'customer', 'personnel', 'about', 'the', 'credit', 'adjustment', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'seeing', 'in', 'my', 'account', 'which', 'in', 'the', 'first', 'place', 'made', 'me', 'transfer', 'an', 'extra', 'xxxx', 'dollars', 'to', 'that', 'first', 'bofa', 'customer', 'person', 'told', 'me', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'from', 'a', 'claim', 'that', 'i', 'initiated', 'for', 'a', 'atm', 'deposit', 'i', 'told', 'them', 'i', 'never', 'initiatedany', 'such', 'claim', 'so', 'we', 'tried', 'to', 'tarck', 'who', 'initially', 'filed', 'that', 'claim', 'we', 'came', 'to', 'know', 'that', 'someone', 'impersonated', 'me', 'and', 'called', 'bofa', 'and', 'filed', 'that', 'claim', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'clear', 'case', 'of', 'identity', 'theft', 'and', 'fraud', 'but', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'is', 'not', 'considering', 'this', 'as', 'a', 'fruad', 'and', 'not', 'takinh', 'any', 'action', 'to', 'get', 'me', 'atleast', 'the', 'two hundred thousand', 'that', 'i', 'only', 'paid', 'because', 'i', 'saw', 'that', 'credit', 'in', 'my', 'account', 'after', 'some', 'more', 'digging', 'i', 'came', 'to', 'know', 'that', 'some', 'one', 'a', 'male', 'called', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'though', 'i', 'am', 'a', 'female', 'and', 'solely', 'hold', 'the', 'account', 'the', 'person', 'was', 'able', 'to', 'identify', 'himself', 'as', 'me', 'by', 'giving', 'my', 'account', 'number', 'i', 'gave', 'for', 'initial', 'transfer', 'and', 'date', 'of', 'birth', 'from', 'my', 'xxxx', 'profile', 'he', 'failed', 'multiple', 'time', 'to', 'identify', 'himself', 'on', 'the', 'type', 'of', 'account', 'last', 'deposit', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'cvv', 'number', 'because', 'he', 'never', 'had', 'that', 'info', 'bofa', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'him', 'there', 'and', 'atleast', 'had', 'called', 'on', 'the', 'cell', 'number', 'associated', 'with', 'the', 'account', 'to', 'confirm', 'the', 'activity', 'they', 'never', 'called', 'me', 'but', 'the', 'customer', 'agen', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'escalated', 'the', 'case', 'to', 'her', 'manager', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'and', 'she', 'gave', 'him', 'what', 'he', 'wanted', 'i', 'feel', 'bofa', 'was', 'very', 'negligent', 'while', 'dealing', 'this', 'case', 'and', 'now', 'they', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'accepting', 'the', 'fact', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'there', 'mistake']"

0,2,24,70,"My problem combines two policies from Bank of America-their overdraft policy and their "" monthly maintenance fee '' policy.
<P/>
I have a checking account with Bank of America and have had this same account open with them for about 8 years now, since I was a XXXX in high school. The amount of money this bank has taken from me has been grossly unethical yet still legal due to their self-serving and shady policies. I woke up today with a text alert notifying me that my account had been assessed an overdraft fee for {$35.00} because I did not bring my account to positive quickly enough. I have it set up so that I receive daily text notifications sent to my phone in order for me to keep updated with my balance and hopefully avoid overdraft items.
<P/>
Yesterday ( XXXX ) apparently my account had gone negative due to a recurring payment I have taken out with XXXX. However I was not aware the entire day because XXXX XXXX XXXX EST-I received a text message alert from Bank of America with my balance, reflecting a low balance yet still a positive amount. I went my entire day unaware that later on sometime that day, my account had gone into negative standing.
<P/>
It was an error on my part to not remember exactly what date I have these recurring automatic payments set up, however even so, I believe that it is irresponsible and dishonest on Bank of America 's part for : 1 ) creating their overdraft policy so that if/when a customer 's account balance does go negative, that customer only has the time from which they realized their account balance was negative until XXXX XXXX  that same day. They are adamant and rigid with dates when it comes to certain aspects to these policies but less consistent when it comes to other aspects ( i.e., the dates Bank of America assesses/applies their account fees vary and it is apparently justified by their mentioning of pay period cycles ).
<P/>
2 ) Handling customers ' bank accounts in such a way that processsing of fees are re-ordered and delayed, thus reflecting an inaccurate account balance to their customers ( this has happened to me countless times ) leading them to spend more than they actually have. This is called "" high to low processing '' and it is a highly unethical yet perfectly legal trend practiced by banks.
<P/>
Now in regards to how their policy on their "" monthly maintenance fee '' has affected me for some time now. This monthly fee is {$12.00} and was not applicable to me until recently because of my age. Their policy on their "" monthly maintenance fee '' contains loopholes, that as a result unfairly made me start paying these fees once I hit a certain age and/or was no longer a XXXX. I was told that I was of a certain age and that is why the monthly maintenance fees started, however I was still a XXXX.
<P/>
I looked back a few months into my account history and noticed that Bank of America routinely has withdrawn this monthly maintenance fee on the XXXX of each month. Yet, this latest fee was deducted from my account on XXXX and not the XXXX like months prior. I brought this up to Bank of America to see if this could maybe waive my overdraft fee, but instead I received a justification as to WHY this last monthly maintenance was withdrawn all a different date and that is because "" the pay period cycle varies each month due to months having different numbers of days. '' This is just another way they can use wording and irrelevant distractions to continue to justify their unethical practices. When it comes to withdrawing monthly maintenance fees, Bank of America does not consistently withdraw it on the same date yet their policy regarding overdraft fees allows no room for variation in dates and mandates that a customers ' account must be brought to positive standing before midnight that same day or else they will be charged the {$35.00} fee.
<P/>
These are clearly dishonest and manipulated practices led by Bank of America that have resulted in me paying this institution money that I should not have paid.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL

3,17,2,44,"I opened a safe deposit box at Bank of America in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. The safe deposit box was subsequently closed and the keys were surrendered in XX/XX/XXXX. At the time of the closure, they were unable to find the documentation to close the safe deposit box ( I believe it was my original signature card ). In XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in the mail saying that I owed a balance for the safe deposit box, and was told by a customer service representative when I called the XXXX number that I needed to contact the branch directly. I spoke with a teammate at the branch and was told that they would research the issue and follow up with me. I called back a week later and was told the same thing. On my third attempt to resolve the issue, I was told that my records were found, and the issue would be corrected. Also I was told that I would be sent a confirmation of closure via mail. In retrospect I never received the confirmation via mail, but as I was told the matter had been resolved I did n't think to follow up again. Today I received another Payment Notice for the safe deposit box with an outstanding balance of {$350.00}. I have n't accessed this box in over a decade now and the last time it was accessed was to validate that it was emptied and surrender the keys. I remember there being an access log, and it should show that I have n't accessed the box since XX/XX/XXXX or earlier. Massachusetts echeatment rules for safe boxes state that after one year of delinquency the bank should send me a 60 day escheatment notice, and escheat the contents to the state. Why am I still being billed for a safe deposit box that has been dormant for over 10 years AND that I closed 10 years ago? I do n't know what records are actually available for the account but certainly there should be record that this account has been dormant for over a decade and that I 'm still being billed for it. This is unfair : the bank is intentionally not closing the box to continue accruing rent. It seems very deceptive. The box should have been closed out years ago and regardless the bank should not have charged me for rent year after year for a delinquent box.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'opened', 'a', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'at', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'or', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'was', 'subsequently', 'closed', 'and', 'the', 'keys', 'were', 'surrendered', 'in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'at', 'the', 'time', 'of', 'the', 'closure', 'they', 'were', 'unable', 'to', 'find', 'the', 'documentation', 'to', 'close', 'the', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'i', 'believe', 'it', 'was', 'my', 'original', 'signature', 'card', 'in', 'xxxxxxxx', 'or', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'received', 'a', 'notice', 'in', 'the', 'mail', 'saying', 'that', 'i', 'owed', 'a', 'balance', 'for', 'the', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'and', 'was', 'told', 'by', 'a', 'customer', 'service', 'representative', 'when', 'i', 'called', 'the', 'xxxx', 'number', 'that', 'i', 'needed', 'to', 'contact', 'the', 'branch', 'directly', 'i', 'spoke', 'with', 'a', 'teammate', 'at', 'the', 'branch', 'and', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'they', 'would', 'research', 'the', 'issue', 'and', 'follow', 'up', 'with', 'me', 'i', 'called', 'back', 'a', 'week', 'later', 'and', 'was', 'told', 'the', 'same', 'thing', 'on', 'my', 'third', 'attempt', 'to', 'resolve', 'the', 'issue', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'my', 'records', 'were', 'found', 'and', 'the', 'issue', 'would', 'be', 'corrected', 'also', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'that', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'sent', 'a', 'confirmation', 'of', 'closure', 'via', 'mail', 'in', 'retrospect', 'i', 'never', 'received', 'the', 'confirmation', 'via', 'mail', 'but', 'as', 'i', 'was', 'told', 'the', 'matter', 'had', 'been', 'resolved', 'i', 'did', 'nt', 'think', 'to', 'follow', 'up', 'again', 'today', 'i', 'received', 'another', 'payment', 'notice', 'for', 'the', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'with', 'an', 'outstanding', 'balance', 'of', 'thirty-five thousand', 'i', 'have', 'nt', 'accessed', 'this', 'box', 'in', 'over', 'a', 'decade', 'now', 'and', 'the', 'last', 'time', 'it', 'was', 'accessed', 'was', 'to', 'validate', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'emptied', 'and', 'surrender', 'the', 'keys', 'i', 'remember', 'there', 'being', 'an', 'access', 'log', 'and', 'it', 'should', 'show', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'nt', 'accessed', 'the', 'box', 'since', 'xxxxxxxx', 'or', 'earlier', 'massachusetts', 'echeatment', 'rules', 'for', 'safe', 'boxes', 'state', 'that', 'after', 'one', 'year', 'of', 'delinquency', 'the', 'bank', 'should', 'send', 'me', 'a', 'sixty', 'day', 'escheatment', 'notice', 'and', 'escheat', 'the', 'contents', 'to', 'the', 'state', 'why', 'am', 'i', 'still', 'being', 'billed', 'for', 'a', 'safe', 'deposit', 'box', 'that', 'has', 'been', 'dormant', 'for', 'over', 'ten', 'years', 'and', 'that', 'i', 'closed', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'i', 'do', 'nt', 'know', 'what', 'records', 'are', 'actually', 'available', 'for', 'the', 'account', 'but', 'certainly', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'record', 'that', 'this', 'account', 'has', 'been', 'dormant', 'for', 'over', 'a', 'decade', 'and', 'that', 'i', 'm', 'still', 'being', 'billed', 'for', 'it', 'this', 'is', 'unfair', 'the', 'bank', 'is', 'intentionally', 'not', 'closing', 'the', 'box', 'to', 'continue', 'accruing', 'rent', 'it', 'seems', 'very', 'deceptive', 'the', 'box', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'and', 'regardless', 'the', 'bank', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'charged', 'me', 'for', 'rent', 'year', 'after', 'year', 'for', 'a', 'delinquent', 'box']"

0,2,20,82,"{$1700.00} was fraudulently charged on my husband 's debit card from our joint checking and savings accounts from the of XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. The charges were in amounts under {$100.00} made multiple times at the same XXXX and XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX California. Most of the charges were done for the same amount multiple times within the same day. They were made while my husband and I were both at work and on vacation at stores we never and have never shopped at. In a town we do n't live in. We reported these charges right away to Bank of America. The funds were then returned to our accounts and the fraud department was supposedly taking care of it. A month later the fraud department suddenly changed the ruling of those claims being fraud and pulled all of the money from our savings and checking accounts making them negative {$550.00} with additional over draft and low account fees. We called Bank of America right away with this on XX/XX/XXXX, and were told we would be called witchin 24-48hrs. No call was received so I then went to our local branch on XX/XX/XXXX.They contacted claims where we were told a letter was sent to us about all of it. We never received any notifications. We were told then the claim would be resubmitted and again would be contacted within 24-48hrs. Again no contact. I emailed the accounts manager I had talked to that day at the branch as she had told me to the previous day if I had not heard back in 24hrs. On XX/XX/XXXX I again called the claims department asking about the status of our refund. They said they would expedite it again and I should be notified by the following day. The accounts manager called me as well saying to let her know if they refunded my money by the next day or if not she would have her manager take charge of the claim. Still no response or money returned. My husband called again XX/XX/XXXX where he was told the claim had been restarted all over so we would not be getting any kind of response until XX/XX/XXXX. I called XX/XX/XXXX and this time was told no claim had ever been filed. This is now going on two weeks with our checking account in the negative and our savings completely wiped out from charges we did not make. Bank of America is claiming since my husband 's chip and or pin was used at two of the transactions and since they were not large sums at one time that it was n't fraud. Whether is was small amounts over time or one page purchase {$1700.00} was stolen. We were on vacation literally watching the charges appear on our account through our mobile banking app and unable to do anything about it. We called XXXX XXXX like we were told. We would have called the moment w saw it but over XXXX XXXX weekend all the claims/fraud offices were closed so we couldn't.A bank that is suppose to protect our money and help us when things like this happen is blaiming us and letting criminals steal our money and charging us extra for it. We ca n't pay our bills, we have no money and all because of this.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['one hundred and seventy thousand', 'was', 'fraudulently', 'charged', 'on', 'my', 'husband', 's', 'debit', 'card', 'from', 'our', 'joint', 'checking', 'and', 'savings', 'accounts', 'from', 'the', 'of', 'xxxxxxxx', 'until', 'xxxxxxxx', 'the', 'charges', 'were', 'in', 'amounts', 'under', 'ten thousand', 'made', 'multiple', 'times', 'at', 'the', 'same', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'in', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'california', 'most', 'of', 'the', 'charges', 'were', 'done', 'for', 'the', 'same', 'amount', 'multiple', 'times', 'within', 'the', 'same', 'day', 'they', 'were', 'made', 'while', 'my', 'husband', 'and', 'i', 'were', 'both', 'at', 'work', 'and', 'on', 'vacation', 'at', 'stores', 'we', 'never', 'and', 'have', 'never', 'shopped', 'at', 'in', 'a', 'town', 'we', 'do', 'nt', 'live', 'in', 'we', 'reported', 'these', 'charges', 'right', 'away', 'to', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'the', 'funds', 'were', 'then', 'returned', 'to', 'our', 'accounts', 'and', 'the', 'fraud', 'department', 'was', 'supposedly', 'taking', 'care', 'of', 'it', 'a', 'month', 'later', 'the', 'fraud', 'department', 'suddenly', 'changed', 'the', 'ruling', 'of', 'those', 'claims', 'being', 'fraud', 'and', 'pulled', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'money', 'from', 'our', 'savings', 'and', 'checking', 'accounts', 'making', 'them', 'negative', 'fifty-five thousand', 'with', 'additional', 'over', 'draft', 'and', 'low', 'account', 'fees', 'we', 'called', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'right', 'away', 'with', 'this', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'and', 'were', 'told', 'we', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'witchin', '2448hrs', 'no', 'call', 'was', 'received', 'so', 'i', 'then', 'went', 'to', 'our', 'local', 'branch', 'on', 'xxxxxxxxthey', 'contacted', 'claims', 'where', 'we', 'were', 'told', 'a', 'letter', 'was', 'sent', 'to', 'us', 'about', 'all', 'of', 'it', 'we', 'never', 'received', 'any', 'notifications', 'we', 'were', 'told', 'then', 'the', 'claim', 'would', 'be', 'resubmitted', 'and', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'contacted', 'within', '2448hrs', 'again', 'no', 'contact', 'i', 'emailed', 'the', 'accounts', 'manager', 'i', 'had', 'talked', 'to', 'that', 'day', 'at', 'the', 'branch', 'as', 'she', 'had', 'told', 'me', 'to', 'the', 'previous', 'day', 'if', 'i', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'back', 'in', '24hrs', 'on', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'again', 'called', 'the', 'claims', 'department', 'asking', 'about', 'the', 'status', 'of', 'our', 'refund', 'they', 'said', 'they', 'would', 'expedite', 'it', 'again', 'and', 'i', 'should', 'be', 'notified', 'by', 'the', 'following', 'day', 'the', 'accounts', 'manager', 'called', 'me', 'as', 'well', 'saying', 'to', 'let', 'her', 'know', 'if', 'they', 'refunded', 'my', 'money', 'by', 'the', 'next', 'day', 'or', 'if', 'not', 'she', 'would', 'have', 'her', 'manager', 'take', 'charge', 'of', 'the', 'claim', 'still', 'no', 'response', 'or', 'money', 'returned', 'my', 'husband', 'called', 'again', 'xxxxxxxx', 'where', 'he', 'was', 'told', 'the', 'claim', 'had', 'been', 'restarted', 'all', 'over', 'so', 'we', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'getting', 'any', 'kind', 'of', 'response', 'until', 'xxxxxxxx', 'i', 'called', 'xxxxxxxx', 'and', 'this', 'time', 'was', 'told', 'no', 'claim', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'filed', 'this', 'is', 'now', 'going', 'on', 'two', 'weeks', 'with', 'our', 'checking', 'account', 'in', 'the', 'negative', 'and', 'our', 'savings', 'completely', 'wiped', 'out', 'from', 'charges', 'we', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'is', 'claiming', 'since', 'my', 'husband', 's', 'chip', 'and', 'or', 'pin', 'was', 'used', 'at', 'two', 'of', 'the', 'transactions', 'and', 'since', 'they', 'were', 'not', 'large', 'sums', 'at', 'one', 'time', 'that', 'it', 'was', 'nt', 'fraud', 'whether', 'is', 'was', 'small', 'amounts', 'over', 'time', 'or', 'one', 'page', 'purchase', 'one hundred and seventy thousand', 'was', 'stolen', 'we', 'were', 'on', 'vacation', 'literally', 'watching', 'the', 'charges', 'appear', 'on', 'our', 'account', 'through', 'our', 'mobile', 'banking', 'app', 'and', 'unable', 'to', 'do', 'anything', 'about', 'it', 'we', 'called', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'like', 'we', 'were', 'told', 'we', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'the', 'moment', 'w', 'saw', 'it', 'but', 'over', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'weekend', 'all', 'the', 'claimsfraud', 'offices', 'were', 'closed', 'so', 'we', 'couldnta', 'bank', 'that', 'is', 'suppose', 'to', 'protect', 'our', 'money', 'and', 'help', 'us', 'when', 'things', 'like', 'this', 'happen', 'is', 'blaiming', 'us', 'and', 'letting', 'criminals', 'steal', 'our', 'money', 'and', 'charging', 'us', 'extra', 'for', 'it', 'we', 'ca', 'nt', 'pay', 'our', 'bills', 'we', 'have', 'no', 'money', 'and', 'all', 'because', 'of', 'this']"

I filed a dispute with claims department at XXXX XXXX our time on XXXX/XXXX/2017.I was told that she give me a temporary credit on my acount for the XXXX transactions and theover draft fees. Well two hours later i called back to talk toa supervisor of my bank in claims to be told that they will not credit back the transactions unti ten business days later and the overdarft fees another three to five business days after that. thisis not right as it was an unauthorized purchase and should have been credited right away after the dispute was filed. i do not appreciate being lied to as first lady in claims said she was working on the credits back right then only mention of the ten days was that i get a letter sign it send it back to the bank.

Bank of America has engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organized enterprise with their representatives and third party agents and are guilty of activities covered under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organized ( RICO ) Act. 

Bank of America has intentionally withheld material information from me during the modification process. Specifically, I had been granted a MHA HAMP on appeal and Bank of America chose to make misrepresentations to me as to the true status of this account, borrower, mortgage, Deed of Trust, and real property intended to bring about the improper separation of me and my home. 

Nothing Bank of America has said or done since XXXX XXXX, XXXX changes any of these facts. Everything Bank of America has done, represented and misrepresented to me since XXXX XXXX, XXXX was designed and intended to separate me from my home. 

There has never been an UCC Financing Statement and Assignment of Rents associated with the XXXX Bank of America Note and Deed of Trust, so Bank of America and their representatives can not collect on any default through the sale of the mortgaged property a a matter of law. However, the State of California, through XXXX, does have the right and first dibbs on any rents generated through the property in the event of default through their XXXX Deed of Trust. Additionally, the XXXX XXXX Deed of Trust must be paid off before the real property and title can be transferred as a matter of law. Therefore, there are many violations of law that may be put forth as affirmative defenses or causes of action if this matter is litigated in California XXXX Court. 

If the United States of America government will not take decisive action in this and similar matters, then a private or nonprofit organization should be encouraged to do so under the Private Attorney General Doctrine with financial support and other resources provided by the federal government. 

A resolution of immediate payment of {$11000.00} by check dawn on a local bank is desired.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'the', 'trustee', 'attorney', 'has', 'claimed', 'to', 'have', 'nothing', 'to', 'do', 'with', 'the', 'foreclosure', 'sale', 'at', 'auction', 'but', 'have', 'represented', 'to', 'me', 'through', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'their', 'legal', 'counsel', 'their', 'are', 'still', 'in', 'the', 'process', 'of', 'post', 'foreclosure', 'sale', 'activities', 'and', 'are', 'unable', 'to', 'tender', 'payment', 'of', 'the', 'one million, one hundred thousand', 'owed', 'to', 'me', 'upon', 'sale', 'both', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'are', 'unnecessarily', 'holding', 'back', 'the', 'amount', 'i', 'am', 'owed', 'it', 'is', 'now', 'two', 'months', 'post', 'foreclosure', 'sale', 'and', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'in', 'receipt', 'of', 'payment', 'that', 'through', 'the', 'representations', 'made', 'to', 'me', 'by', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'and', 'xxxx', 'have', 'been', 'delayed', 'without', 'explanation', 'if', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'had', 'three', 'weeks', 'to', 'sale', 'my', 'home', 'via', 'foreclosure', 'sale', 'at', 'auction', 'then', 'they', 'should', 'have', 'only', 'three', 'weeks', 'from', 'the', 'date', 'of', 'sale', 'to', 'pay', 'out', 'any', 'monies', 'owed', 'to', 'the', 'foreclosure', 'upon', 'party', 'the', 'bottom', 'line', 'is', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'their', 'partners', 'in', 'crime', 'are', 'a', 'sheisty', 'and', 'grimy', 'business', 'enterprise', 'incomparable', 'to', 'any', 'other', 'criminal', 'racket', 'including', 'xxxx', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'engage', 'in', 'a', 'racketeer', 'influenced', 'corrupt', 'organized', 'enterprise', 'with', 'their', 'representatives', 'and', 'third', 'party', 'agents', 'and', 'are', 'guilty', 'of', 'activities', 'covered', 'under', 'the', 'racketeer', 'influenced', 'corrupt', 'organized', 'rico', 'act', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'intentionally', 'withheld', 'material', 'information', 'from', 'me', 'during', 'the', 'modification', 'process', 'specifically', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'granted', 'a', 'mha', 'hamp', 'on', 'appeal', 'and', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'chose', 'to', 'make', 'misrepresentations', 'to', 'me', 'as', 'to', 'the', 'true', 'status', 'of', 'this', 'account', 'borrower', 'mortgage', 'deed', 'of', 'trust', 'and', 'real', 'property', 'intended', 'to', 'bring', 'about', 'the', 'improper', 'separation', 'of', 'me', 'and', 'my', 'home', 'nothing', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'said', 'or', 'done', 'since', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'changes', 'any', 'of', 'these', 'facts', 'everything', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'has', 'done', 'represented', 'and', 'misrepresented', 'to', 'me', 'since', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'was', 'designed', 'and', 'intended', 'to', 'separate', 'me', 'from', 'my', 'home', 'there', 'has', 'never', 'been', 'an', 'ucc', 'financing', 'statement', 'and', 'assignment', 'of', 'rents', 'associated', 'with', 'the', 'xxxx', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'note', 'and', 'deed', 'of', 'trust', 'so', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'and', 'their', 'representatives', 'can', 'not', 'collect', 'on', 'any', 'default', 'through', 'the', 'sale', 'of', 'the', 'mortgaged', 'property', 'a', 'a', 'matter', 'of', 'law', 'however', 'the', 'state', 'of', 'california', 'through', 'xxxx', 'does', 'have', 'the', 'right', 'and', 'first', 'dibbs', 'on', 'any', 'rents', 'generated', 'through', 'the', 'property', 'in', 'the', 'event', 'of', 'default', 'through', 'their', 'xxxx', 'deed', 'of', 'trust', 'additionally', 'the', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'deed', 'of', 'trust', 'must', 'be', 'paid', 'off', 'before', 'the', 'real', 'property', 'and', 'title', 'can', 'be', 'transferred', 'as', 'a', 'matter', 'of', 'law', 'therefore', 'there', 'are', 'many', 'violations', 'of', 'law', 'that', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'forth', 'as', 'affirmative', 'defenses', 'or', 'causes', 'of', 'action', 'if', 'this', 'matter', 'is', 'litigated', 'in', 'california', 'xxxx', 'court', 'if', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'of', 'america', 'government', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'decisive', 'action', 'in', 'this', 'and', 'similar', 'matters', 'then', 'a', 'private', 'or', 'nonprofit', 'organization', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'to', 'do', 'so', 'under', 'the', 'private', 'attorney', 'general', 'doctrine', 'with', 'financial', 'support', 'and', 'other', 'resources', 'provided', 'by', 'the', 'federal', 'government', 'a', 'resolution', 'of', 'immediate', 'payment', 'of', 'one million, one hundred thousand', 'by', 'check', 'dawn', 'on', 'a', 'local', 'bank', 'is', 'desired']"

0,2,20,7,"There are unauthorized charges to my debit card in excess of {$300.00} posted on XXXX/XXXX/2017. I went through all the proper channels to resolve this dispute as it is Bank of America 's statement that a customer is never responsible for unauthorized charges made to their bank card. My claim was denied THREE times. They sped through a myriad of reasons on why they denied my claim that are all based on speculative "" evidence. '' I felt like I was being treated like a criminal when I 'm the victim of fraud. One reason for denial was that the signature was similar to the one signed on the fraudulent purchase. The only problem is that on the back of all their cards, it clearly states that the card is not valid or authorized until signed. As a result, ANYBODY can glance at the back and forge a signature so that evidence just throws itself out the window. Another reason for denial was that I did n't report it in a speedy manner. This one makes me cringe. As per Bank of America 's directions, they advise to wait till the bogus transaction posts, contact the company FIRST AND THEN contact the bank if there is no resolution ; I did just that in a timely fashion. So again, this denial reason is ludicrous. This joke of an investigation is criminal and so are the practices of this bank. They have denied my claims before and are rarely, if ever, on my side. But this time, I 've had enough being stepped on and bullied. The so-called investigators have Bank of America 's interest in mind and are n't concerned to whether or not there is actual PROOF, their job is to deny claims and save and generate money for the bank in a bureaucratic fashion. This is a conflict of interest. The letter that this bank has send me with their "" proof '' is all speculative. And speculation never trumps real evidence. I BEGGED for video or photo evidence and was told they do n't do that. We are talking about a stadium that holds over 55,000 people and there is n't one camera around?

I strongly believe that my loan from its conception is wrapped up in that neat little package. This is why I am asking your office to help me resolve the ongoing dispute about what exactly do I owe on my loan and how can the pool of banks involved get away with such fraudulent activities by passing the protocol of ALLONGES, ASSIGNMENTS AND ENDORSEMENTS. According to the Article 5 Residential Mortgage Fraud and the Federal Laws we have so many unanswered questions and concerns that have left us faithless in our Judicial System and its band of promises to protect the rights of all its citizens. I have sent out inquires to the OIG of the Department of Veteran Affairs, Attorney General XXXX XXXX, and many others just to name a few.I am quite dissatisfied with the process set up by the CFPB the

1,8,25,80,"My issue is with Bank of America with whom I have had my checking/savings accounts over the past 10 years. What has prompted my complaint is that I recently started using a bank of america preferred cash rewards credit card ( for supposed premium customers ) along with other cards such as  XXXX  or   XXXX   XXXX  . In addition to these credit cards I have several others with other major bank credit cards. In every major institution with the exception of BOA, the ability to set up recurring payments for the full balance amount is extremely easy to do online. With the BOA credit card accounts they have deliberately set up their online payment system to allow recurring payments but only through a fixed amount as opposed to allowing multiple options of : a ) a fixed amount. b  ) minimum payment. c )  statement balance. d ) total balance. All other bank credit cards I have afford all those options.  <P/> In order to get around this, consumers have to submit a written form for payments or call a third party firm to do what every other major bank allows online. For Bank of America to set up a payment structure in this manner is clearly intended to take advantage of consumers. By hindering consumer ability to pay off their credit cards they are clearly trying to exploit customers to pay insufficient minimum payment fees or interest fees because NO  ONE  has a fixed credit card fee every month. As such WHY would they have a reoccurring payment option with the only option of a fixed fee unless it 's to exploit their customers? I refuse to believe this is just because of stupidity.","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['my', 'issue', 'is', 'with', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'with', 'whom', 'i', 'have', 'had', 'my', 'checkingsavings', 'accounts', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'what', 'has', 'prompted', 'my', 'complaint', 'is', 'that', 'i', 'recently', 'started', 'using', 'a', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'preferred', 'cash', 'rewards', 'credit', 'card', 'for', 'supposed', 'premium', 'customers', 'along', 'with', 'other', 'cards', 'such', 'as', 'xxxx', 'or', 'xxxx', 'xxxx', 'in', 'addition', 'to', 'these', 'credit', 'cards', 'i', 'have', 'several', 'others', 'with', 'other', 'major', 'bank', 'credit', 'cards', 'in', 'every', 'major', 'institution', 'with', 'the', 'exception', 'of', 'boa', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'set', 'up', 'recurring', 'payments', 'for', 'the', 'full', 'balance', 'amount', 'is', 'extremely', 'easy', 'to', 'do', 'online', 'with', 'the', 'boa', 'credit', 'card', 'accounts', 'they', 'have', 'deliberately', 'set', 'up', 'their', 'online', 'payment', 'system', 'to', 'allow', 'recurring', 'payments', 'but', 'only', 'through', 'a', 'fixed', 'amount', 'as', 'opposed', 'to', 'allowing', 'multiple', 'options', 'of', 'a', 'a', 'fixed', 'amount', 'b', 'minimum', 'payment', 'c', 'statement', 'balance', 'd', 'total', 'balance', 'all', 'other', 'bank', 'credit', 'cards', 'i', 'have', 'afford', 'all', 'those', 'options', 'p', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'get', 'around', 'this', 'consumers', 'have', 'to', 'submit', 'a', 'written', 'form', 'for', 'payments', 'or', 'call', 'a', 'third', 'party', 'firm', 'to', 'do', 'what', 'every', 'other', 'major', 'bank', 'allows', 'online', 'for', 'bank', 'of', 'america', 'to', 'set', 'up', 'a', 'payment', 'structure', 'in', 'this', 'manner', 'is', 'clearly', 'intended', 'to', 'take', 'advantage', 'of', 'consumers', 'by', 'hindering', 'consumer', 'ability', 'to', 'pay', 'off', 'their', 'credit', 'cards', 'they', 'are', 'clearly', 'trying', 'to', 'exploit', 'customers', 'to', 'pay', 'insufficient', 'minimum', 'payment', 'fees', 'or', 'interest', 'fees', 'because', 'no', 'one', 'has', 'a', 'fixed', 'credit', 'card', 'fee', 'every', 'month', 'as', 'such', 'why', 'would', 'they', 'have', 'a', 'reoccurring', 'payment', 'option', 'with', 'the', 'only', 'option', 'of', 'a', 'fixed', 'fee', 'unless', 'it', 's', 'to', 'exploit', 'their', 'customers', 'i', 'refuse', 'to', 'believe', 'this', 'is', 'just', 'because', 'of', 'stupidity']"

The withdrawal, which totaled  XXXX , took a total  XXXX  from our account and made the account negative in the amount of  XXXX .

The bank subsequently debited my brother-in-laws account for the funds paid out because they claimed the check appeared to be forged.

XXXX : Statute of Limitations requires a lender to take an actionto enforce within 6 years of the acceleration for written contracts. Law dictionary define an action as : n. a lawsuit in which one party ( or parties ) sues another. I still have not been a party to a lawsuit that would toll the statute. Exhibit 7 XXXX/XXXX/XXXX comes and goes and no lawsuit is filed. The lender has had over 7 years to take action, still no lawsuit filed, and over 6 years of the Statute of Limitations running.

Now, the lender is wrongfully trying to collect a debt that is barred from collection AGAIN! 

Either way, the 6-year SOL has passed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, over 302 days past the 6 year tolling date, and over 8 years past the first late payment. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agrees to continue the sale until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to look into this further. See Exhibit XXXX.

We moved out of the home and lived with family to avoid a "" Sheriff style eviction '' Foreclosure never happened, we were in limbo, not sure what to do. We moved back in temporarily. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Eventually, at the advice of an attorney, XXXX filed Bankruptcy. He got a job in Florida so we moved to Florida to rebuild. 
XXXX - The mortgage finally drops off our credit report because of the federal Statute of Limitations. For 6 years we could n't get a car loan, rent a house, or finance anything without lots of help. Even with a co signor, a {>= $1,000,000} mortgage that is unpaid for 6 years is a big deal. We thought this was the end, and things would finally start to get better. We got a $ XXXX/month car loan and start to rebuild. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - Surprise ... A Notice of Trustee Sale is recorded for the sale of our home after over 7 years of demanding payment in full, and no follow through. XXXX called the attorney representing the trustee told him I did n't think they had the right to foreclose because it had been XXXX years since they called the note due and Washington State has a 6 year statute of limitations. He was an arrogant jerk and said he could rely on whatever the bank was giving him and if I did n't like it, we had to retain an attorney and sue the bank to stop them. We had also done some research and told him that this was Agriculture property and they could legally not Non Judicially foreclose, they had to go through the courts system and the burden would XXXX to them to prove they had the right to foreclose. He did n't like this at all and got really mad and said he did n't even have to talk to me and I needed to get an attorney to talk to him from there on. For the next year we get notices saying that the sale is continued. We hire an attorney to write a few demand letters but they ignore them and take the position, if we do n't like it, we have to sue them. We demand that they prove they have legal standing and have complied with all the state and federal lending and foreclosure laws. They ignore us and say they do n't have to prove anything, state law does n't require them to. Sale dates come and go, and get continued without an actual sale. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Trustee records a discontinuance of the previous sale and sets a new date for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a new Notice of Trustee Sale. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Current Sale date for the most recent Notice of Trustee Sale. 
Current : Just learn now that we can not get a new Mortgage together, and start over, until another XXXX7 years AFTER the foreclose date that has n't even happened yet!!! XXXX15 years of punishment. 
They are n't lawfully allowed to foreclose and I think they know it, but they have unlimited financial resources and we do not. So, they will keep threatening and just do what they want to do because they can operate above the law. This is wrong and we need help, please.

3,3,7,39,"I have being going through a dispute with Bank of America for a while now in regards to a fraudulent cc. Bank of America is an extremely dishonest organization. I say that because I have more than provided proof that I did not apply for a card. I want to start off by saying after discovering this fraudulent debt, I contacted Bank of America and provided them my address in which I have been at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX almost 10 years. Meaning this is where I was when they claim they sent a card, ask Bank of America, where did they send a credit card to? I have sent them a copy of my property taxes which shows the date I moved in. The time that they state they issued a card it was not sent to my address, review the application. This is the address in which I was located at when the card was issued. If they look at the information on their application, it does not match my address and they know that. Next they indicated, that I signed the application, I never signed a application, did Bank of America see me sign an application, no, nor have I seen an application. Next, they indicated that XXXX my daughter and I shared a bank account in which payments where paid from. Please send the checks or what ever payments were made as I never authorized any payments to the organization, we never shared an account. Then I sent them a letter from XXXX in which they indicated they transferred funding to a XXXX account. When I sent them the document from XXXX indicating the account in which they indicated funds where transferred to was a fraudulent account, Bank of America is indicating that the XXXX letter was referring to a lease when that is a lie, the XXXX letter was indeed a letter in reference to a fraudulent credit card in which they stated about transferring funds to. I have produced documents to show my residence at the time of this credit card. I was not living at the address in which they have. I showed my voter 's registration card to also confirm my address at the time of this card. I have given them a letter from XXXX in which Bank of America lied stating it was a letter for a lease it is not. Please provide me a letter from them so I can sue you and XXXX if they told you that lie. I inquired as to why I was not contacted before issuing credit, because I have had a fraud alert for numerous years including the period of the issuance of this card, they would have been aware I did not apply. Then I have also sent a copy of my XXXX mortgage document, which showed my previous address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address which was the address prior to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Residence. This document also has my signature. I have provided more than enough information to show this was fraud. This company needs to remove this fraudulent debt as I have to sue. I can not be responsible for an account I knew nothing of. Then they have the audacity to state I benefitted from it. I never received anything from this organization. This company should have a copy of my license, social security or something to be sure that they are issuing credit to the party on their application. I have no reason to be go through all of this and to be dishonest. During this period my husband and son were XXXX, trust me, the furthest thing from my mind would to be applying for a card with your organization. Perhaps if you go through this horrendous event of your XXXX XXXX XXXX son XXXX and your spouse and then they lose their life, let me know if you would be thinking about applying for a credit card, unbelievable. I pay for what I get, so I have no reason to be dishonest with this company. It 's sad that they know that I did not receive a card and they want to hold me liable, this is unreal. If you have enough proof that XXXX is liable, you hold her liable but I never received, applied or benefitted from anything from your org","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION","['i', 'have',

3,3,7,44,"XX/XX/XXXX, I entered an agreement with XXXX in Minnesota following a stipulation and Confession of Judgement dated XX/XX/XXXX. I was supposed to make 9 payments total of XXXX each and I made the payments religiously until the last two payments when the creditors contacted us to say that they have severed relationship with XXXX XXXX and we should send subsequent payments to another collection agency, FIA Card Services. They gave us the new information. I completed the remaining two payments with FIA Card Services XX/XX/XXXX. To my greatest dismay, XXXX XXXX filed a judgement again me in XXXX County District Court on XX/XX/XXXX, claiming that I did not complete payment. I immediately responded with evidence of having paid the account in full, which I sent via certified mail. They received it because I received confirmation to that effect. Not hearing from them after sending the documents, I followed with several phone calls that they never returned. Now the judgement is still effective and all attempts to reach XXXX XXXX to withdraw the judgement have failed. It may interest you to know also that whenever I called and gave them the last XXXX digits of my social, another person 's name pops up. At one time, they said that the account did not exist and transferred me to a voice message that never got back to me. 

I have had several problems with this agency. When Bank of America severed relationship with them, I was told that it was due to some inappropriate business practices. I also feel that they are trying to stick someone else 's debt on me but it backfired due to their negligence and lack of organization. It may also very well be a malicious act on their part. 

What is even more upsetting is that they file frivolous lawsuits to get people to succumb due to lack of representation or resources. They also never send any notice of any filing or notice of summon, and just surprise people with a judgement against them. They have tried to remove funds from my account at XXXX time, claiming that my husband owed them and that too backfired, because they could not prove that my husband was on the account, and they tried as much as possible to transfer whatever they are claiming he owes them to me. This is a constant harassment from this agency and I crave your indulgence in this matter. I need justice!
